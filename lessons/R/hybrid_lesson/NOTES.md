## TITLE

* Programming in `R`: Part One

## ETHERPAD

* Please use the Etherpad for the course

## LEARNING OBJECTIVES

* We're being **QUITE AMBITIOUS**, and covering a few things, but we **HAVE TWO SESSIONS**, so should be OK
* We'll be covering the fundamentals of `R` and `RStudio` - how to **GET AROUND `R` AND WHAT `RStudio` CAN DO**
* You'll come away with fundamental knowledge applicable to **PROGRAMMING IN ANY LANGUAGE**
* We'll be learning some of the best practices for writing and organising your code (**FOLLOWING ON FROM GIT**) and for reproducible computing
* Finally, we'll be going through how to use these skills to be **MORE EFFECTIVE WITH DATA ANALYSIS** in `R`

## SECTION 01: Introduction to `R` and `RStudio`

**SLIDE: Learning Objectives**

* We're going to talk in general terms about **WHAT `R` and `RSTUDIO` are**.
* We're also going to discuss **WHAT MAKES THEM DIFFERENT FROM SOME OTHER TOOLS** you might already use for similar tasks, like `Excel`

----

**SLIDE: What is `R`?**

* `R` is a **PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE**, and the **SOFTWARE** that runs programs written in that language.
* `R` is **AVAILABLE ON ALL PLATFORMS**
* This can sometimes be confusing - **IF AT ANY POINT I AM UNCLEAR, PLEASE ASK!**

* **HAS ANYONE IN THE ROOM USED `R` BEFORE? - GREEN STICKY**
    * If anyone has used `R`, please could you be available to help one of your neighbours who has not, if they have any questions. Look around you - if there's someone nearby with a green sticky, say 'hi'!

* **WHY USE OR TEACH `R`?**
    * `R` is **FREE**, and very **WIDELY-USED** across a range of disciplines.
    * There are **MANY USEFUL PACKAGES** or data analysis and statistics
    * It has excellent **GRAPHICS CAPABILITIES**
    * There is an international, friendly **COMMUNITY** across a range of disciplines, so it's easy to find local and online support

----

**SLIDE: But I already know `Excel`**

* I'm **NOT HERE TO CRITICISE `EXCEL`**. `Excel` is brilliant at what it's meant to do. It's **POWERFUL** and **INTUITIVE**.
* But **`R` HAS MANY ADVANTAGES FOR REPRODUCIBLE AND COMPLEX ANALYSIS**

* A key thing for reproducibility is that it **SEPARATES DATA FROM ANALYSIS**.
    * In `R`, when you do anything to the original data, that original data remains unmodified (unless you overwrite the file).
    * **POINT OF GOOD PRACTICE: RAW DATA SHOULD BE READ-ONLY**
    * In `Excel` however it's easy to overwrite data with copy-and-paste (and many bad things have happened as a result) - see Mike Croucher's talk for examples.

* Because **YOUR ANALYSIS IN `R` IS A PROGRAM**, every step is written down explicitly, and is transparent and understandable by someone else.
    * In `Excel`, there is no clear record of where you moved your mouse, or what you copied and pasted, and it's not immediately obvious how your formulas work.

* `R` code is **EASY TO SHARE AND ADAPT**, and to apply again to a different or a modified input dataset. It's easy to publish the analyses via online resources, such as GitHub.
* `R` code can also be **RUN ON EXTREMELY LARGE DATASETS**, quickly. That's much harder in `Excel`.

----

**SLIDE: What is `RStudio`?**

* `RStudio` is an **INTEGRATED DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT** - which is to say it's a very powerful tool for writing and using `R` and programs in the `R` language.
    * It's available on **ALL PLATFORMS**
    * It's available as a webserver, too.

* On the left is a screenshot **WHILE I WAS WRITING THIS PRESENTATION IN RSTUDIO** on a Mac
* On the right is the Windows version, with an **EXAMPLE ANALYSIS AND VISUALISATION**

* You can use it to **INTERACT WITH `R` DIRECTLY TO EXPERIMENT WITH DATA**
* It has a **CODE/SCRIPT EDITOR FOR WRITING PROGRAMS**
* It has tools for **VISUALISING DATA**
* It has built-in **GIT INTEGRATION FOR MANAGING YOUR PROJECTS**

##Â SECTION 02: Getting To Know `RStudio`

**SLIDE: Learning Objectives**

* We need to get some **FAMILIARITY WITH OUR WORKING ENVIRONMENT**: the `RStudio` IDE
* Develop some **BEST PRACTICES FOR PROJECT MANAGEMENT** in general, and in `RStudio`
* We'll **BUILD UPON THE `GIT` LESSON** because `RStudio` integrates naturally with `git` to keep all your analysis and code under version control.
* We'll introduce `R` syntax, and **SEE HOW `R` REPRESENTS DATA** and how to **PROGRAM IN `R`**
* If we have time we'll deal with **MANAGING SOME OF THE MANY USEFUL PACKAGES** available in `R`

----

**SLIDE: `RStudio` overview - Interactive Demo**

* **START `RStudio`** (click icon/go into start menu and select RStudio/etc.)
    * **CHECK EVERYONE CAN START `RSTUDIO`**

![images/red_green_sticky.png](images/red_green_sticky.png)

* **REMIND PEOPLE THEY CAN USE RED/GREEN STICKIES AT ANY TIME**
* You should see **THREE PANELS**
    * Interactive `R` console: **you can type here and get instant feedback**
    * Environment/History window
    * Files/Plots/Packages/Help/Viewer: **interacting with files on the computer, and viewing help and some output**

* We're going to use `R` in the interactive console to get used to some of the features of the language, and `RStudio`. **DEMO CODE: ASK PEOPLE TO TYPE ALONG**
    * **THE RIGHT ANGLED BRACKET IS A PROMPT: `R` EXPECTS INPUT**
    * **TYPE THE CALCULATION, THEN PRESS RETURN**

```R
> 1 + 100
[1] 101
> 30 / 3
[1] 10
```

* **RESULT IS INDICATED WITH A NUMBER `[1]`** this indicates the line with output in it
* If you type an **INCOMPLETE COMMAND**, `R` will wait for you to complete it
    * **DEMO CODE**

```R
> 1 +
+ 
```

* The **PROMPT CHANGES TO `+` WHEN `R` EXPECTS MORE INPUT**
* You can either complete the line, or use `Esc` (`Ctrl-C`) to exit

```R
> 1 +
+ 6
[1] 7
> 1 + 
+ 

> 
```

* `R` obeys the usual **PRECEDENCE OPERATIONS** ( `(`, `**`/`^`, `/`, `*`, `+`, `-`)
    * **DEMO CODE: NOTE SPACES AROUND OPERATORS**

```R
> 3 + 5 * 2
[1] 13
> (3 + 5) * 2
[1] 16
> 3 + 5 * 2 ^ 2
[1] 23
> 3 + 5 * (2 ^ 2)
[1] 23
```

* **ARROW KEYS RECOVER OLD COMMANDS**
* **THE `HISTORY` TAB SHOWS ALL COMMANDS USED**
* `R` will report in **SCIENTIFIC NOTATION**
    * **CHECK THAT EVERYONE KNOWS WHAT SCIENTIFIC NOTATION IS**

![images/red_green_sticky.png](images/red_green_sticky.png)

```R
> 2 / 1000
[1] 0.002
> 2 / 10000
[1] 2e-04
> 5e3
[1] 5000
```

* `R` has many **STANDARD MATHEMATICAL FUNCTIONS**
* **FUNCTION SYNTAX**
     * type the function name
     * open parentheses
     * type input value
     * close parentheses
     * press return
     * **DEMO CODE**

```R
> sin(1)
[1] 0.841471
> log(1)
[1] 0
> log10(10)
[1] 1
> log(10)
[1] 2.302585
```

* How do we learn more about a function, or the difference between `log()` and `log10()`?
* **USE `R` BUILT-IN HELP**
    * Type `?` then the function name
    * Scroll to the bottom of the page to find example code

```R
> ?log
```

* This brings up help in the **HELP WINDOW**
* You can also use the **SEARCH BOX** at the top of the help window (try `sin()`)
* If you're not sure about spelling, the editor has **AUTOCOMPLETION** which will suggest all possible endings for something you type (try `log`) - **USE TAB TO SEE AUTOCOMPLETIONS**

* We can do **COMPARISONS** in `R`
    * Comparisons return `TRUE` or `FALSE`. **DEMO CODE**
    * **NOTE:** when comparing numbers, it's better to use `all.equal()` (*machine numeric tolerance*) **ASK IF THERE'S ANYONE FROM MATHS/PHYSICS**

```R
> 1 == 1
[1] TRUE
> 1 != 2
[1] TRUE
> 1 < 2
[1] TRUE
> 1 <= 1
[1] TRUE
> 1 > 0
[1] TRUE
> 1 >= -9
[1] TRUE
> all.equal(1.0, 1.0)
[1] TRUE
> all.equal(1.0, 1.1)
[1] "Mean relative difference: 0.1"
> all.equal(pi-1e-7, pi)
[1] "Mean relative difference: 3.183099e-08"
> all.equal(pi-1e-8, pi)
[1] TRUE
> pi-1e-8 == pi
[1] FALSE
```

**SLIDE: Variables**

* **VARIABLES** are critical to programming in general, and also to working in `R`
* Variables are like **NAMED BOXES**
    * Like a box, they **HOLD THINGS**
    * When we make reference to a box's name, we **MEAN THE THING THE BOX CONTAINS**
* Here, the box is called `Name`, and it contains the word `Samia`
* When we refer to the box, we call it `Name`, and we might ask questions like:
    * "What is the length of `Name`?", meaning "What is the length of the word in the box called `Name`?" (answer: 5)

----

**SLIDE: Variables - Interactive Demo**

* This is a very important concept, so we're going to go through some practical examples, to reinforce it
    * In `R`, variables are assigned with the **ASSIGNMENT OPERATOR** `<-`
    * We will assign the value `1/40` to the variable `x`
    * **DEMO CODE**

```R
> x <- 1 / 40
```

* At first, nothing seems to happen, but we can see that the variable `x` now exists, and contains the value `0.025` - a **DECIMAL APPROXMATION** of the fraction `1/40`

```R
> x
[1] 0.025
```

* **CLICK ON THE ENVIRONMENT WINDOW**
    * You should see that `x` is defined, there
* The *Environment* window in `RStudio` tells you the name and content of every variable currently active in your `R` session.

* This **VARIABLE CAN BE USED ANYWHERE THAT EXPECTS A NUMBER**
    * such as an argument to a function

```R
> log(x)
[1] -3.688879
> sin(x)
[1] 0.0249974
> x + x
[1] 0.05
> 2 * x
[1] 0.05
> x ^ 2
[1] 0.000625
```

* We can **REASSIGN VALUES TO VARIABLES**
    * **MONITOR THE VALUE OF `x` IN THE ENVIRONMENT WINDOW**
    * We can also assign a variable to itself, to modify the variable

```R
> x <- 100
> x <- x + 5
```

* We can assign **ANY KIND OF VALUE** to a variable
    * Including **STRINGS** - i.e. sets of characters

```R
> name <- "Samia"
> name
[1] "Samia"
```

* But **BE CAREFUL** - `R` is not always intuitive
    * Strings in particular may not work the way you expect

```R
> length(name)
[1] 1
> nchar(name)
[1] 5
```

----

**SLIDE: Functions**

* You've now used some **functions**. These are like "canned scripts"
* Functions have **THREE MAIN PURPOSES**
    * They **ENCAPSULATE COMPLEX TASKS** - you don't need to worry about how a sine is calculated, just that you give the function a value, and it tells you what the sine is.
    * They **MAKE CODE MORE READABLE** - by dividing code into logical operations, represented by short names, the code is easier to read
    * They also **MAKE CODE MORE REUSABLE** - you don't need to write the routine for finding a square root every time you want one, you just need to call the `sqrt()` function
* **ALL THE FUNCTIONS YOU'VE SEEN ARE BUILT-IN**, the so-called `base` functions
* **OTHER FUNCTIONS FOR SPECIFIC TASKS CAN BE BROUGHT IN, THROUGH `libraries`**

* Functions usually **TAKE ARGUMENTS** (input), e.g. `sqrt(4)` - the `4` is an argument
* Functions often **RETURN** values (output), e.g. `sqrt(4)` **returns** the value `2`

----

**SLIDE: Getting Help for Functions**

* **DEMO IN CONSOLE**

```R
> args(lm)
function (formula, data, subset, weights, na.action, method = "qr", 
    model = TRUE, x = FALSE, y = FALSE, qr = TRUE, singular.ok = TRUE, 
    contrasts = NULL, offset, ...) 
NULL
> ?sqrt
> help(sqrt)
> ??sqrt
> help.search("sqrt")
> help.search("categorical")
> vignette(two-table)
Error in vignette(two - table) : object 'two' not found
> vignette("two-table")
```

----

**SLIDE: Removing Variables**

* To remove **ONE OR MORE SPECIFIED VARIABLES**, use `rm()`
    * **`ls()` IS A FUNCTION THAT LISTS VARIABLES** (like the Environment tab) 
    * **DEMO CODE**

```R
> x <- 1
> y <- 2
> z <- 3
> ls()
[1] "x" "y" "z"
> rm(x)
> ls()
[1] "y" "z"
> rm(y, z)
> ls()
character(0)
```

----

**SLIDE: Challenge 02**

Solution:

`mass <- 47.5`
This will give a value of 47.5 for the variable mass

`age <- 122`
This will give a value of 122 for the variable age

`mass <- mass * 2.3`
This will multiply the existing value of 47.5 by 2.3 to give a new value of 109.25 to the variable mass.

`age <- age - 20`
This will subtract 20 from the existing value of 122 to give a new value of 102 to the variable age.

**SLIDE: Good Variable Names**

* Good variable names **SHOULD HELP YOU DESCRIBE WHAT'S GOING ON**
    * Helpful **FOR YOU AND FOR OTHERS**
* It's better to **avoid using names that already exist**
* Use a **CONSISTENT NAMING STYLE**

* Rules for **VARIABLE NAMES DIFFER BETWEEN LANGUAGES**
* **IN `R`**
    * You can only use **LETTERS, NUMBERS, UNDERSCORES, AND PERIODS**
    * You **can't start variable names with a number**
    * You **can't use whitespace in a variable name**

----

**SLIDE: Good Project Management Practices**

* There is **NO SINGLE GOOD WAY TO ORGANISE A PROJECT**
    * It's important to find something that **WORKS FOR YOU**
    * But it's **ALSO IMPORTANT THAT IT WORKS FOR COLLABORATORS**
    * Some **PRINCIPLES MAKE THINGS EASIER FOR EVERYONE**

* Using a **SINGLE WORKING DIRECTORY PER PROJECT/ANALYSIS**
    * **NAME IT AFTER THE PROJECT**
    * **EASY TO PACKAGE UP** the whole directory and move it around, or share it - **OR PUBLISH ALONGSIDE YOUR PAPER**
    * **NO NEED TO HUNT AROUND THE WHOLE DISK** to find relevant or important files.
    * You can use **RELATIVE PATHS** that will always work, so long as you work within the project directory
* Treat your **RAW DATA AS READ-ONLY**
    * Establishes **PROVENANCE** and **ENABLES REANALYSIS**
    * Keep in **SEPARATE SUBFOLDER**
* **CLEAN THE DATA PROGRAMMATICALLY** (part of the analysis chain)
    * Remove/fill in null values, etc. - whatever is appropriate
    * **KEEP CLEANED DATA SEPARATE FROM RAW** - like food hygiene
* **GENERATED OUTPUT IS DISPOSABLE**
    * This means **ANYTHING GENERATED AUTOMATICALLY BY YOUR CODE/ANALYSIS**
    * If a file can be generated by scripts/code in your project, no need to put it under version control

----

**SLIDE: Example Directory Structure**

* This is **ONE WAY TO STRUCTURE YOUR WORKING DIRECTORY**
    * It's a good starting point, but something else might be more appropriate for your own work

* **`WORKING DIR/`** is the *root* directory of the project.
    * Everything related to the project (subdirectories of data, scripts and figures; `git` files; configuration files; notes to yourself; whatever)
* **`data/`** is a subdirectory for storing data
    * raw data only, or raw and intermediate data? **YOUR DECISION**
    * `data/raw`, `data/intermediate` - **USE SUBFOLDERS WHEN SENSIBLE**
* **`data_output/`** could be a place to write the analysis output (`.csv` files etc.)
* **`documents/`** is a place where notes, drafts, and explanatory text could be stored
* **`fig_output/`** could be a place to write graphical output of the analysis (keep separate from tables)
* **`scripts`** might be where you would choose to keep executable code that automates your analysis

* The important thing is that the structure is **SELF-EXPLANATORY WHERE POSSIBLE**

----

**SLIDE: Project Management in `RStudio`**

* `RStudio` **TRIES TO BE HELPFUL** and provides the 'Project' concept
    * Keeps **ALL PROJECT FILES IN A SINGLE DIRECTORY**
    * **INTEGRATES WITH `GIT`**
    * Enables switching between projects within `RStudio`
    * Keeps project histories

* **INTERACTIVE DEMO**

* **CREATE PROJECT**
* Click `File` -> `New Project`
    * Options for how we want to create a project: brand new in a new working directory; turn an existing directory into a project; or checkout a project from `GitHub` or some other repository
* Click `New Directory`
    * Options for various things we can do in `RStudio`. Here we want `New Project`
* Click `New Project`
    * We are asked for a directory name. **ENTER `swc-r-lesson`**
    * We are asked for a parent directory. **PUT YOURS ON THE DESKTOP; STUDENTS CAN CHOOSE ANYWHERE SENSIBLE**
    * **SELECT `Create a git repository`** - this will create and initialise a `git` repository, just for this project
* Click `Create Project`
* **YOU SHOULD SEE AN EMPTY-ISH `RSTUDIO` WINDOW**

* **INSPECT PROJECT ENVIRONMENT**
* First, **NOTE THE WINDOWS**: editor; environment; files
* **EDITOR** is empty
* **ENVIRONMENT** is empty
* **FILES** shows
    * **CURRENT WORKING DIRECTORY** (see breadcrumb trail)
    * **TWO FILES**: `*.Rproj` - information about your project; `.gitignore` - your project's `.gitignore` file (remember the `git` lesson?)
* **CLICK ON `GIT` TAB**
    * We see that the files are not yet added to the project (status is `?`)
    * **CHECK BOXES TO STAGE FILES**
    * **CLICK ON `DIFF` TO SEE CHANGES** (note colours, lines, etc.)
    * **CLICK ON `COMMIT` TO COMMIT CHANGES**
    * **WRITE COMMIT MESSAGE** (add .gitignore and R project files to repo)
    * **CLICK `COMMIT`** (explain message)

* **CREATE DIRECTORIES IN PROJECT**
* **Create directoris called `scripts` and `data`**
    * Click on `New Folder`
    * Enter directory name (`scripts`)
    * Note that the directory now exists in the `Files` tab (but not in the `git` tab, as the directory is empty)
    * Do the same for `data/`
* **NOTE THAT WE WILL NOW POPULATE THE DIRECTORY**

----

**SLIDE: Working in RStudio**

* `RStudio` offers **SEVERAL WAYS TO WRITE CODE**
    * We'll not see all of them today
    * You've seen **DIRECT INTERACTION IN THE CONSOLE** (entering variables)
    * `RStudio` also has an editor for writing scripts, notebooks, markdown documents, and Shiny applications (**EXPLAIN BRIEFLY**)
    * It can also be used to write plain text

* **INTERACTIVE DEMO OF `R` SCRIPT**

* Click on `File` -> `New File` -> `Text File`. **NOTE THAT THE EDITOR WINDOW OPENS**
* Enter the following text, and **EXPLAIN CSV**
    * plain text file
    * one row per line
    * column entries separated by commas
    * first row is header data
    * **NEEDS A BLANK LINE AT THE END**
    * **DATA DESCRIBES CATS**

```
coat,weight,likes_string
calico,2.1,1
black,5.0,0
tabby,3.2,1

```

* **SAVE THE FILE AS `data/feline_data.csv`**
    * Click on disk icon
    * Navigate to `data/` subdirectory
    * Enter filename `feline_data.csv`
* **NOTE CHANGES IN `GIT` TAB**
    * The `data` directory appears!
    * Click on `Staged` and **THE FILE APPEARS**
    * Click `Commit` and add a commit string, e.g. "add cat dataset"
* **CLOSE THE EDITOR FOR THAT FILE**

* Click on `File` -> `New File` -> `R Script`.
* **EXPLAIN COMMENTS** while entering the code below
    * **COMMENTS ANNOTATE YOUR CODE**: reminders for you, and information for others
* **EXPLAIN `read.csv()`**
    * `read.csv()` is a **FUNCTION** that reads data from a **CSV-FORMAT FILE** into a variable in `R`
 
```R
# Script for exploring data structures

# Load cat data as a dataframe
cats <- read.csv(file = "data/feline_data.csv")
```

* **SAVE THE SCRIPT**
   * Click on `File` -> `Save`
   * Navigate to the `scripts/` subdirectory
   * Enter filename `data_structures` (**EXTENSION IS AUTOMATICALLY APPLIED**)
**NOTE CHANGES IN `GIT` TAB**
   * The `scripts` directory appears!
   * Click on `Staged` and the file appears
   * Click on `Commit` and add a commit string, e.g. "add data structures script"
* **DO YOU SEE THE VARIABLE IN THE ENVIRONMENT?**
   * **NO** - because the code hasn't been executed, only written.

* **RUN THE SCRIPT**
   * Click on `Source` and **NOTE THIS RUNS THE WHOLE SCRIPT**
* Go to the `Environment` tab
   * **NOTE THE DATA WAS LOADED IN THE VARIABLE `cats`**
   * Note that there is a description of the data (3 obs. of 3 variables)
   * **CLICK ON THE VARIABLE AND NOTE THAT THE TABLE IS NOW VISIBLE** - this is helpful
   * **YOU CANNOT EDIT THE DATA IN THIS TABLE** - you can sort and filter, but not modify the data. This **ENFORCES GOOD PRACTICE** (compare to Excel).

**SLIDE: Learning Objectives**

* We're going to cover some ways of loading data into an `R` project/analysis
* We'll **EXPLORE SOME FUNCTIONS FOR SUMMARISING DATA**
* Sometimes we want to use only a portion of our data, and we'll see some **WAYS OF INDEXING DATASETS**
* We'll also look at some ways to **PLOT DATA IN R**, using the built-in *base graphics*

----

**SLIDE: Our Task**

* We've got some medical data relating to a new treatment for arthritis
* There are some measurements of patient inflammation, taken over a period of days post-treatment for each patient
* We've been **ASKED TO PRODUCE A SUMMARY AND SOME GRAPHS**

* **DOWNLOAD THE FILE FROM THE LINK TO `data/`**
* **EXPLAIN THE LINK IS ON THE ETHERPAD PAGE** (no need to type!)
* **DEMO THIS**
    * **NOTE:** A new directory is created *within* `data`, called `data`. **THIS IS UNTIDY, SO LET'S CLEAN**
    * **COPY ALL FILES BEGINNING WITH `inflammation` TO THE PARENT FOLDER**
    * **THEN DELETE THE SUBFOLDER AND ZIP FILE**
    * **ADD THE DATA FILES TO THE REPO** (can shift-click, here)

* **CHECK EVERYONE'S READY TO PROCEED**

---- 

**SLIDE: Loading Data - Interactive Demo**

* We've already created some cat data manually, but **THIS IS UNUSUAL** - most data comes in the form of plain text files

**START DEMO**
* **INSPECT DATA IN FILES WINDOW**
    * Click on filename, and select `View File`
    * Note: **THERE IS NO HEADER** and **THERE ARE NO ROW NAMES**
    * Ask: **IS THIS WELL-FORMATTED DATA?**
    * I happen to know that there is **one row per patient, and the columns are days, in turn, post-treatment**, and **measurements are inflammation levels**
* **WHAT IS THE DATA TYPE**
    * Tabular, with **EACH COLUMN SEPARATED BY A COMMA**, so **CSV**
    * **IN THE CONSOLE** use `read.csv()` to read the data in
    * Note: **IF WE DON'T ASSIGN THE RESULT TO A VARIABLE WE JUST SEE THE DATA**
* **CREATE A NEW SCRIPT**
    * Click the **triangle next to the new document icon**
    * Add the code and **SAVE AS `scripts/inflammation`** (`RStudio` adds the extension)
    * See that the file appears in `Files` and `Git` windows

```R
# Preliminary analysis of inflammation in arthritis patients

# Load data (no headers, CSV)
data <- read.csv(file = "data/inflammation-01.csv", header = FALSE)
```

* **INSPECT THE DATA**
    * `Source` the script
    * Check the `Environment` window: 60 observations (patients) of 40 variables (days)
    * **CLICK ON `data`**
    * **COLUMN HEADERS ARE PROVIDED: `Vn`** for *variable n*
    * `dim()` - *dimensions* of data: rows X columns
    * `length()` - number of columns in the table
    * `ncol()` - number of columns in the table
    * `nrow()` - number of rows in the table

```R
> head(data, n = 2)
  V1 V2 V3 V4 V5 V6 V7 V8 V9 V10 V11 V12 V13 V14 V15 V16 V17 V18 V19 V20 V21 V22 V23 V24 V25 V26

**SLIDE: Indexing Data**

* We can refer to an element in our dataset by *indexing* it
    * We **LOCATE A SINGLE ELEMENT as `[row, column]` in square brackets**

```R
> ncol(data)

* To get a **RANGE OF VALUES**, use the `:` separator to mean 'to':

```R
> data[1:4, 1:4]   # rows 1 to 4; columns 1 to 4
  V1 V2 V3 V4
1  0  0  1  3
2  0  1  2  1
3  0  1  1  3
4  0  0  2  0
> data[30:32, 20:22]
   V20 V21 V22
30  16  14  15
31  16  13   7
32   9  19  15
```

* To get a **WHOLE ROW OR COLUMN**, leave that entry blank

```R
> data[5,]
  V1 V2 V3 V4 V5 V6 V7 V8 V9 V10 V11 V12 V13 V14 V15 V16 V17 V18 V19 V20 V21 V22 V23 V24 V25 V26

**SLIDE: Repetitive Calculations - Interactive Demo**

* We might want to **CALCULATE MEAN INFLAMMATION FOR EACH PATIENT**, but doing it the way we've just seen is tedious and slow.
* Happily **COMPUTERS WERE INVENTED TO SAVE US THE HASSLE**
* We could automate this task in any of several ways available in `R`
    * What we'd like to do is **APPLY A FUNCTION TO EACH ROW**
    * `R` has an `apply()` function exactly for this
    * **IN THE CONSOLE**

```R
> apply(X = data, MARGIN = 1, FUN = mean)
 [1] 5.450 5.425 6.100 5.900 5.550 6.225 5.975 6.650 6.625 6.525 6.775 5.800 6.225 5.750 5.225
[16] 6.300 6.550 5.700 5.850 6.550 5.775 5.825 6.175 6.100 5.800 6.425 6.050 6.025 6.175 6.550
[31] 6.175 6.350 6.725 6.125 7.075 5.725 5.925 6.150 6.075 5.750 5.975 5.725 6.300 5.900 6.750
[46] 5.925 7.225 6.150 5.950 6.275 5.700 6.100 6.825 5.975 6.725 5.700 6.250 6.400 7.050 5.900
```

* **IN OUR ANALYSIS SCRIPT** we want to assign these values to a variable, and **ALSO CALCULATE AVERAGE BY DAY**
    * So long as we provide arguments in the correct order, **WE DON'T NEED TO PROVIDE ARGUMENT NAMES** - true for most `R` functions

```R
# Calculate average inflammation by patient and day
avg_inflammation_patient <- apply(X = data, MARGIN = 1, FUN = mean)
avg_inflammation_day <- apply(data, 2, mean)
```

* **RUN THE LINES**
    * Note that the values appear in the Environment tab
* Like many common operations, there's an `R` function that's a shortcut
    * **IN THE CONSOLE**

**SLIDE: Base Graphics**

* We're doing all this work to try to **GAIN INSIGHT INTO OUR DATA**
* **VISUALISATION IS A KEY ROUTE TO INSIGHT**

* `R` has many graphics packages - some of which produce extremely beautiful images, or are tailored to a specific problem domain
* The built-in graphics are known as *base graphics*
* They may not be as pretty, or as immediately suited for all circumstances as some other packages, but they are still very powerful

**SLIDE: Plotting - Interactive Demo**

* **IN THE SCRIPT**
    * `R`'s **`plot()` FUNCTION IS GENERAL AND WORKS FOR MANY KINDS OF DATA**
    * **RUN EACH LINE IN TURN**
    * **NOTE WHERE PLOTS SHOW** (Plot window)
    * Opportunity to note: **VARIABLES HELP READABILITY**
    * **USE ARROW BUTTONS** to cycle through plots
    * **COMMIT CHANGES WHEN DONE**

```R
# Plot data summaries
# Average inflammation by patient
plot(avg_inflammation_patient)

# Average inflammation per day
plot(avg_inflammation_day)

# Maximum inflammation per day
max_inflammation_day <- apply(data, 2, max)
plot(max_inflammation_day)

# Minimum inflammation per day
plot(apply(data, 2, min))

# Show a historgram of average patient inflammation
hist(avg_inflammation_patient)
```

* **THE `hist()` FUNCTION PLOTS A HISTOGRAM OF INPUT DATA FREQUENCY/COUNT**
    * The choice of bin sizes/*breaks* could be improved
    * We need to **PROVIDE THE BOUNDARIES BETWEEN BINS**
    * **IN THE CONSOLE**

```R
hist(avg_inflammation_patient, breaks=c(5, 6, 7, 8))
```

* We'd have to **TYPE IN A LOT OF NUMBERS** to get smaller breaks, which is **SLOW**
    * The `seq()` function generates a sequence of numbers for us

```R
> seq(5, 8)
[1] 5 6 7 8
> hist(avg_inflammation_patient, breaks=seq(5, 8))
```

* We can **SET THE INTERVAL OF THE SEQUENCE**

```R
> seq(5, 8, by=0.2)
 [1] 5.0 5.2 5.4 5.6 5.8 6.0 6.2 6.4 6.6 6.8 7.0 7.2 7.4 7.6 7.8 8.0
> hist(avg_inflammation_patient, breaks=seq(5, 8, by=0.2))
``` 

* **IN THE SCRIPT**
    * Add a line with the histogram for average patient inflammation

```R
# Show a historgram of average patient inflammation
hist(avg_inflammation_patient, breaks=seq(5, 8, by=0.2))
```

* **IN THE SCRIPT**
   * Demonstrate changing the input file
   * **CHANGING FILENAME IN A SCRIPT IS QUICKER THAN RETYPING ALL THE COMMANDS**

**SLIDE: 04. Data Structures in `R`**

----

**SLIDE: Learning Objectives**

* In this section, you'll be learning about the data types in `R`: **WHAT DATA IS**
* You'll also be learning about the data *structures*: **WHAT DATA IS BUILT INTO - HOW IT IS ARRANGED**
* And you'll also learn how to find out what type/structure a particular piece of data has
* Putting it together, you'll see how `R`'s data types and structures relate to the types of data that you work with, yourself.

----

**SLIDE: Data Types and Structures in `R`**

* `R` is **MOSTLY USED FOR DATA ANALYSIS**
* `R` is set up with key, core data types designed to help you work with your own data
* A lot of the time, `R` focuses on tabular data (like our cat example)
* **INTERACTIVE DEMO**

* **SWITCH TO THE CONSOLE** (Establish that `cats` is available as a variable)
* If you type `cats`, you get a nice tabular representation of your data 

```R
> cats
    coat weight likes_string
1 calico    2.1            1
2  black    5.0            0
3  tabby    3.2            1
```

* **THINK ABOUT THE DATA TYPES** Are they all the same?
    * **NO** `coat` is text; `weight` is some real value (in kg or pounds, maybe), and `likes_string` looks like it should be `TRUE`/`FALSE`
    * **DOES IT MAKE SENSE TO WORK WITH THEM AS IF THEY'RE THE SAME THING?** (No)

* **EXTRACT A COLUMN FROM A TABLE**
   * Use `$` notation in the console
   * **NOTE THE AUTOCOMPLETION**

```R
> cats$weight
[1] 2.1 5.0 3.2
```

* **WHAT DID `R` RETURN?**
    * A *vector* (1D ordered collection) of numbers
* **WE CAN OPERATE ON THESE *VECTORS* **
    * *Vectors* are an important concept, and `R` is largely built so that operations on vectors are central to data analysis.

```R
> cats$weight + 2
[1] 4.1 7.0 5.2
```

* **WHAT ABOUT OTHER COLUMNS?**

```R
> cats$coat
[1] calico black  tabby 
Levels: black calico tabby
```

* **WHAT DID `R` RETURN?**
    * A *vector* of *levels*
    * We'll talk about these in more detail shortly, but the key point is that `R` **DOESN'T THINK THEY'RE ONLY WORDS** - it **THINKS THEY'RE NAMED CATEGORIES OF OBJECT**. `R` is assuming that you mean to import *data*
    * We can operate on this vector, too (**EXPLAIN `paste()`**)

```R
> paste("My cat is", cats$coat)
[1] "My cat is calico" "My cat is black"  "My cat is tabby" 
```

* **WHAT HAPPENS NEXT?**

```R
> cats$weight + cats$coat
[1] NA NA NA
Warning message:
In Ops.factor(cats$weight, cats$coat) : â+â not meaningful for factors
```

* You probably already realised that wasn't going to work, because adding "calico" to "2.1" is nonsense.
* **THESE DATA TYPES ARE NOT COMPATIBLE** for addition
* `R`'s data types reflect the ways in which data is expected to interact
* **UNDERSTANDING HOW YOUR DATA MAP TO `R`'s DATA TYPES IS KEY**
   * It's very important to understand how `R` sees your data (you want `R` to see your data the same way you do)
   * Many problems in `R` come down to incompatibilities between data and data types.

----

**SLIDE: What Data Types Do You Expect?**

* **ASK THE STUDENTS**
    * What data types would you expect to see?
    * What data types do you think you would **WANT OR NEED**, from your own experience?
* **SPEND A COUPLE OF MINUTES ON THIS**
    * The difference between a *data type* and a *data structure*

----

**SLIDE: Data Types in `R`**

* `R`'s data *types* are *atomic*: they are **FUNDAMENTAL AND EVERYTHING ELSE IS BUILT UP FROM THEM**, like matter is built up from atoms
    * In particular, all the data *structures* are built up from data *types*
* There are only **FIVE DATA TYPES** in `R` (though one is split into twoâ¦)
    * **logical**: Boolean, True/False (also `1`/`0`)
    * **numeric**: anything that's a number on the number line; two types of number are supported: `integer` and `double` (real)
    * **complex**: complex numbers, defined on the 2D plane
    * **character**: text data - readable symbols
    * **raw**: binary data (we'll not be dealing with this)

* **LET'S LEARN A BIT MORE ABOUT THEM IN THE DEMO**
* **ENTER DEFINITIONS INTO THE SCRIPT**
    * Covering the major data types

```R
# Some variables of several data types
truth <- TRUE
lie <- FALSE
i <- 3L
d <- 3.0
c <- 3 + 0i
txt <- "TRUE"
```

* **EXECUTE THE VARIABLE DEFINITIONS**
    * Select the definition lines
    * Click on `Run`
    * **OBSERVE THAT THE LINES ARE RUN IN THE CONSOLE**
    * **OBSERVE THAT THE VALUES ARE DEFINED IN THE ENVIRONMENT**
    * Note the difference between `Data` and `Values` in the environment
    * Note that the script is updated in the `Git` tab: commit the change

* **USE `typeof()` TO FIND THE TYPE OF A VARIABLE**

```R
> typeof(i)
[1] "integer"
> typeof(c)
[1] "complex"
> typeof(d)
[1] "double"
```

* **TO TEST IF A DATA ITEM HAS A TYPE, USE `is.<type>()`**

```R
> is.numeric(3)
[1] TRUE
> is.numeric(d)
[1] TRUE
> is.double(i)
[1] FALSE
> is.integer(d)
[1] FALSE
> is.numeric(txt)
[1] FALSE
> is.character(txt)
[1] TRUE
> is.character(truth)
[1] FALSE
> is.logical(truth)
[1] TRUE
```

* **THE INTEGER, COMPLEX, AND DOUBLE ARE EQUAL** even if they're not the same data type
    * numbers are comparable, regardless of data type

```R
> i == c
[1] TRUE
> i == d
[1] TRUE
> d == c
[1] TRUE
```

* **INTEGER, COMPLEX AND DOUBLE ARE NOT ALL `numeric`** though

```R
> is.numeric(i)
[1] TRUE
> is.numeric(c)
[1] FALSE
```

**SLIDE: FIVE COMMON `R` DATA STRUCTURES**

* These are perhaps the five data types you'll come across most often in `R`
* We'll deal with them through examples
* **INTERACTIVE DEMO IN SCRIPT**

* **VECTORS**
    * These are the **MOST COMMON DATA STRUCTURE**
    * Vectors can contain **ONLY A SINGLE DATA TYPE** (*atomic vectors*)
    * **ADD CODE TO SCRIPT** then use `Run` to run in console
    * To create a vector **USE THE `c()` FUNCTION** (`c()` is `combine`; use `?c`)
    * First we define an **ATOMIC VECTOR OF NUMBERS** - each element is an integer

```R
# Define an integer vector
x <- c(10, 12, 45, 33)
```

* We can use some `R` functions to find out more about this variable
    * **RUN CODE IN CONSOLE**

```R
> length(x)
[1] 4
> typeof(x)
[1] "double"
> str(x)
 num [1:4] 10 12 45 33
``` 

* The `str()` function **REPORTS THE STRUCTURE OF A VARIABLE**
    * Here, `num` means 'numeric'; `[1:4]` means there are four elements; the elements are listed
    * **NOTE THAT THIS INFORMATION IS IN THE ENVIRONMENT TAB**
    
* **DEFINE A SECOND VECTOR IN THE SCRIPT**

```R
# Define a vector
xx <- c(1, 2, 'a')
```

* In the Environment tab, you can see **THIS IS A CHARACTER VECTOR**

```R
> length(xx)
[1] 3
> typeof(xx)
[1] "character"
> str(xx)
 chr [1:3] "1" "2" "a"
``` 

* **IS THE TYPE OF THE VECTOR WHAT YOU EXPECTED?**
    * This is one of the things that trips people up with `R` - they think their data is of one type, but `R` thinks it makes more sense to have it as another type

----

**SLIDE: Challenge 07**

* Let the students work for a couple of minutes, then demonstrate.

![images/red_green_sticky.png](images/red_green_sticky.png)

----

**SLIDE: Coercion**

* *Coercion* is what happens when you **COVERT ONE DATA TYPE INTO ANOTHER**
* If `R` thinks it needs to, it will **COERCE DATA IMPLICITLY** without telling you
* There is a set order for coercion
    * `logical` can be coerced to `integer`, but `integer` cannot be coerced to `logical`
    * That's because `integer` can describe all `logical` values, but not *vice versa*
    * Everything can be represented as a `character`, so that's the fallback position for `R`
* **IF THERE'S A FORMATTING PROBLEM IN YOUR DATA, `R` MIGHT CONVERT THE TYPE TO COPE**
    * `R` will choose the simplest data type that can represent all items in the vector

* **INTERACTIVE DEMO IN CONSOLE** More useful things to do with vectors
* You can (usually) **COERCE VECTORS MANUALLY** with `as.<type>()`

```R
> as.character(x)
[1] "10" "12" "45" "33"
> as.complex(x)
[1] 10+0i 12+0i 45+0i 33+0i
> as.logical(x)
[1] TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE
> xx
[1] "1" "2" "a"
> as.numeric(xx)
[1]  1  2 NA
Warning message:
NAs introduced by coercion 
> as.logical(xx)
[1] NA NA NA
```

* You can generate **NUMBER SEQUENCES** as vectors
    * The `seq()` function returns a vector
    * As does the `:` operator

```R
> seq(10)
 [1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10
> seq(1, 10)
 [1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10
> seq(35, 40, by=0.5)
 [1] 35.0 35.5 36.0 36.5 37.0 37.5 38.0 38.5 39.0 39.5 40.0
> 1:10
 [1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10
> 5:8
[1] 5 6 7 8 
```

* You can **APPEND ELEMENTS TO A VECTOR WITH `c()`**

```R
> x
[1] 10 12 45 33
> c(x, 57)
[1] 10 12 45 33 57
> x
[1] 10 12 45 33
> x <- c(x, 57)
> x
[1] 10 12 45 33 57
```

* There are useful **FUNCTIONS TO GET INFORMATION ABOUT A VECTOR**

```R
> x <- 0:10
> tail(x)
[1]  5  6  7  8  9 10
> head(x)
[1] 0 1 2 3 4 5
> head(x, n=2)
[1] 0 1
```

* You can **GIVE VECTOR ELEMENTS NAMES** 
    * They're then referred to as *named vectors*

```R
> x <- 1:4
> names(x)
NULL
> str(x)
 int [1:4] 1 2 3 4
> names(x) <- c("a", "b", "c", "d")
> x
a b c d 
1 2 3 4 
> str(x)
 Named int [1:4] 1 2 3 4
 - attr(*, "names")= chr [1:4] "a" "b" "c" "d"
```

----

**SLIDE: Factors**

* In general **DATA COMES AS ONE OF TWO TYPES**
    * *Quantitative data* represents measurable values. These are usually either **CONTINUOUS** (real values like a height in centimetres) or a **COUNT**  (like number of beans in a tin).
    * *Categorical* data representing **DISCRETE GROUPS**, which can be **UNORDERED** (like "types of computer"; "educational establishments") or **ORDERED** (like floors of a building, or grades in school)

* **THIS DISTINCTION IS CRITICAL IN MANY STATISTICAL/ANALYTICAL METHODS**
* `R` **WAS MADE FOR STATISTICS** so has a special way of dealing with the difference

* **FACTORS ARE SPECIAL VECTORS REPRESENTING *CATEGORICAL* DATA**
    * Factors are stored as **VECTORS OF LABELLED INTEGERS**
    * Factors **CANNOT BE TREATED AS TEXT**

* **CREATE FACTOR IN SCRIPT**
    * We create a **FACTOR WITH THREE ELEMENTS**
    * `Run` the line
    * Commit the change

```R
# Create a factor with three elements
> f <- factor(c("no", "yes", "no"))
```

* **INSPECT THE FACTOR IN THE CONSOLE**
   * When we look at the *structure* of the vector, it reports **TWO LEVELS**: `"yes"` and `"no"`
   * It also reports a list of values: `1 2 1`
   * There is a mapping `"no" -> 1` and `"yes" -> 2`
   * The **VECTOR STORES INTEGERS `1` and `2`, BUT THESE ARE LABELLED `"no"` and `"yes"`**

```R
> length(f)

**SLIDE: Matrices**

* *Matrices* may be the **MOST IMPORTANT DATA STRUCTURE IN NUMERICAL ANALYSIS**, central to pretty much any statistical operation
* **THEY GET THEIR OWN SPECIAL DATA STRUCTURE IN `R`**
* They are 2D `vector`s (so contain atomic values)

* **CREATE MATRICES IN SCRIPT**
   * `Run` the lines when done
   * Commit the changes

```R
# Create matrix of zeroes
m1 <- matrix(0, ncol = 6, nrow = 3)

# Create matrix of numbers 1 and 2
m2 <- matrix(c(1, 2), ncol = 3, nrow = 4)
```

* **INSPECT THE RESULTS IN THE CONSOLE**
    * `ncol` and `nrow` define the size of the matrix
    * providing a single value as the first argument fills the matrix with that value
    * The `length()` of a matrix **IS THE TOTAL NUMBER OF ELEMENTS**

```R
> class(m1)
[1] "matrix"
> m1
     [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] [,6]
[1,]    0    0    0    0    0    0
[2,]    0    0    0    0    0    0
[3,]    0    0    0    0    0    0
> str(m1)
 num [1:3, 1:6] 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ...
 > length(m1)
[1] 18
```

* **PROVIDING TWO VALUES TO THE FIRST ARGUMENT** fills the matrix, too
    * So long as the **LENGTH OF THE MATRIX IS A MULTIPLE OF THE INPUT LENGTH**
    * We can **INDEX AND SLICE** just like before

```R
> m2
     [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4]
[1,]    1    2    1    2
[2,]    2    1    2    1

**SLIDE: Lists**

* `list`s are like *vectors*, **EXCEPT THEY CAN HOLD ANY DATA TYPE**

* **CREATE NEW LIST IN SCRIPT**
    * `Run` from script
    * Commit to repo

```R
# Create a list
l <- list(1, 'a', TRUE, matrix(0, nrow = 2, ncol = 2), f)

# Create a named list
l_named <- list(a = "SWC", b = 1:4)
```

* **INSPECT THE LISTS IN THE CONSOLE**
   * The elements are identified with **DOUBLE SQUARE BRACKETS** `[[n]]`
   * We use this **LIKE ANY OTHER INDEX**

```R
> class(l)
[1] "list"
> class(l_named)
[1] "list"
> str(l)
List of 5
 $ : num 1
 $ : chr "a"
 $ : logi TRUE
 $ : num [1:2, 1:2] 0 0 0 0
 $ : Factor w/ 2 levels "no","yes": 1 2 1
> str(l_named)
List of 2
 $ a: chr "SWC"
 $ b: int [1:4] 1 2 3 4
> l
[[1]]
[1] 1

[[2]]
[1] "a"

[[3]]
[1] TRUE

[[4]]
     [,1] [,2]
[1,]    0    0
[2,]    0    0

[[5]]
[1] no  yes no 
Levels: no yes
> l[[4]][1,1]
[1] 0
```

* **THE NAMED LIST IS SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT**
    * **CAN STILL INDEX**
    * But can also **NOW USE NAMES** with `$`
    * **INDICES CAN CHANGE IF DATA IS MODIFIED - NAMES ARE MORE ROBUST**
    * **NAMES CAN ALSO BE MORE DESCRIPTIVE (HELPS UNDERSTANDING)**

```R
> l_named
$a
[1] "SWC"

$b
[1] 1 2 3 4
> l_named[[1]]
[1] "SWC"
> l_named[[2]]
[1] 1 2 3 4
> l_named$a
[1] "SWC"
> l_named$b
[1] 1 2 3 4
> names(l_named)
[1] "a" "b"
```

**SLIDE: Logical Indexing**

* We've seen **INDEXING** and **NAMES** as ways to get elements from variables **SO LONG AS WE KNOW WHICH ELEMENTS WE WANT**
* **LOGICAL INDEXING** allows us to **SPECIFY CONDITIONS FOR THE DATA WE WANT TO RECOVER**
    * For instance, we might want **ALL VALUES OVER A THRESHOLD** or **ALL NAMES STARTING WITH 'S'**

* **DEMO IN SCRIPT** (`data_structures.R`)
    * We create a vector of values as an example
    * We make a **MASK OF TRUE/FALSE (i.e. logical)** values
    * `Run` the lines

```R
# Create a vector for logical indexing
v <- c(5.4, 6.2, 7.1, 4.8, 7.5)
mask <- c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE, TRUE)
```

* **DEMO IN CONSOLE**
* Now, when we **USE THE MASK AS AN INDEX** we only get **THE ELEMENTS WHERE THE MASK IS TRUE**

```R
> v
[1] 5.4 6.2 7.1 4.8 7.5
> v[mask]
[1] 5.4 7.1 7.5
```

* **COMPARATORS IN `R` RETURN VECTORS OF TRUE/FALSE VALUES**
    * These can be **USED AS LOGICAL MASKS fOR DATA**
    * Comparators **CAN BE COMBINED**

```R
> v
[1] 5.4 6.2 7.1 4.8 7.5
> v < 7
[1]  TRUE  TRUE FALSE  TRUE FALSE
> v[v < 7]
[1] 5.4 6.2 4.8
> v < 7
[1]  TRUE  TRUE FALSE  TRUE FALSE
> v > 5 & v < 7
[1]  TRUE  TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE
> v[v > 5 & v < 7]
[1] 5.4 6.2
> v > 5 | v < 7
[1] TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE
> v[v > 5 | v < 7]
[1] 5.4 6.2 7.1 4.8 7.5

**SLIDE: 05. Dataframes**

* Dataframes are probably the most important thing you will ever learn about, in `R`.
* Almost everything in `R`, on a practical day-to-day basis, involves dataframes

----

**SLIDE: Learning Objectives**

* After this section **YOU WILL UNDERSTAND WHAT A DATAFRAME IS AND HOW IT IS BUILT UP FROM `R` DATA STRUCTURES YOU ALREADY KNOW**
* You'll also know **HOW TO ACCESS ANY PART OF A DATA FRAME, INCLUDING CONDITIONAL ACCESS**
* We'll also see how to read data in to, and write it out from, a data frame.

----

**SLIDE: Let's look at a `data.frame`**

* The `cats` data is a small `data.frame`
* **DEMO IN CONSOLE**
    * **NOTE: TABULAR**
    * **NOTE: 9 elements but length 3?**
    * Try list indexesâ¦Â **IT'S A LIST**
    * Try `names()`â¦ **IT'S A NAMED LIST**
    * What are the classes of each list element? **THEY'RE VECTORS**

```R
> class(cats)

**SLIDE: What is a `data.frame`**

* This structure is **THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IN `R`**
    * It's the standard structure for storing any king of tabular, 'rectangular' data
* We've seen that it's a **NAMED LIST** where each element is a **VECTOR**
    * All the vectors have the same length
* This is **VERY SIMILAR TO A SPREADSHEET**, but it's more finicky:
    * We require every element in a column to be the same data type
    * We need all the columns to be the same length
    * **In spreadsheets, neither of these conditions are enforced**
    * **This makes `R` a bit more data-safe**

**SLIDE: 06. Packages**

----

**SLIDE: Learning Objectives**

* In this short section, we'll learn
    * **what packages are**
    * **how to install them**
    * **how to use them in your code**

----

**SLIDE: Packages**

* Packages are **THE FUNDAMENTAL UNIT OF REUSABLE CODE IN `R`**
* People write code, and **DISTRIBUTE IT IN PACKAGES**
* Packages exist for many **SPECIALIST AND USEFUL TOOLS**
* Over 10,000 packages can be found at CRAN - the Comprehensive R Archive Network
* When you write your own code, you can distribute it as a package

* **DEMO IN CONSOLE**
    * You can **SEE INSTALLED PACKAGES** with the function `installed.packages()`
    * To install a new package, use `install.packages("packagename")` as a string **EXPLAIN DEPENDENCIES**
    * **DEMO INSTALLATION IN `RStudio`: `Tools` $\rightarrow$ `Install packages...`**
    * **DEMO PACKAGE UPDATES IN `RStudio`**
    * You can update your installed packages to the newest version in the console with `update.packages()` **DON'T DO THIS - CAN TAKE TIME!**

```R
> installed.packages()
                  Package            
BiocInstaller     "BiocInstaller"    
bit               "bit"              
bit64             "bit64"            
data.table        "data.table"  
[...]
> install.packages("dplyr")
Installing package into â/Users/lpritc/Library/R/3.4/libraryâ
(as âlibâ is unspecified)
also installing the dependencies âbindrcppâ, âglueâ, ârlangâ

# 07. Creating Publication-Quality Graphics

----

**SLIDE: Visualisation is Critical**

* Visualisation **HELPS US UNDERSTAND OUR DATA**
* But **IT'S NOT FOOLPROOF** - people can interpret the same visualisation differently
* Good visualisation is **MORE THAN JUST USING A PLOTTING TOOL**

----

**SLIDE: Learning Objectives**

* After this section, you should **understand the Grammar of Graphics**
     * You'll be able to produce **INFORMATIVE, BEAUTIFUL GRAPHS THAT EXPLAIN YOUR DATA**
* You'll also be able to use `ggplot2` to generate those plots

----

**SLIDE: The Grammar of Graphics**

* We'll be using the `ggplot2` package, which is part of the **TIDYVERSE**, created initially by Hadley Wickham.
    * The Tidyverse provides **OTHER USEFUL PACKAGES** but you can use `ggplot2` on its own

* `ggplot2` implements **A SET OF CONCEPTS CALLED THE GRAMMAR OF GRAPHICS**
    * This **SEPARATES DATA FROM THE WAY IT'S REPRESENTED** and we'll discuss it in detail
    * It's not the usual way you might have seen to create plots, but it's **highly effective for generating powerful visualisations**

----

**SLIDE: A Basic Scatterplot**

* You can use `ggplot2` in the **SAME WAY YOU'D USE BASE GRAPHICS**
    * This is not the best way to use all the power of the package

* **DEMO IN CONSOLE**
    * **IMPORT LIBRARY**
    * `ggplot2` has **`qplot()` - the equivalent to `plot()` in base graphics**
    * `plot()` takes `x` and `y` values, and will assign colours to `factor` columns
    * `qplot()` takes the name of `x` and `y` columns, plus the name of the source `data.frame`, and will assign colours to `factor` columns

```R
> library(ggplot2)
> plot(gapminder$lifeExp, gapminder$gdpPercap, col=gapminder$continent)
> qplot(lifeExp, gdpPercap, data=gapminder, colour=continent)
```

* **COMPARE THE GRAPHS**
    * Clearly, both graphs **show the same data**
    * The **FORMATTING IS QUITE DIFFERENT**
    * Your preference is your preference - **both methods can be heavily restyled**
    * My view is that **`ggplot2` has nicer default styles**
    * **`ggplot2` provides gridlines and legends by default, and the labelling is clearer** (no `gapminder$` prefix)

* **THIS ISN'T WHAT'S POWERFUL ABOUT `ggplot2`!**

----

**SLIDE: What is a Plot? *aesthetics* **

* **TALK THROUGH THE POINTS**
* Each observation in the data is a *point*
* The *aesthetics* of a point determine how it is rendered in the plot
    * co-ordinates (x, y values) **ON THE IMAGE**
    * size
    * shape
    * colour
    * transparency
* *aesthetics* can be
    * *constant* (e.g. all points the same colour)
    * *mapped to variables* (e.g. colour mapped to continent)

----

**SLIDE: What is a Plot? *aesthetics* **

* The *aesthetics* of a plot **define a new dataset** for each point
* **THIS SHOULD REMIND YOU STRONGLY OF A `data.frame`**

----

**SLIDE: What is a Plot? `geom`s**

* So far **we've only defined the data and aesthetics**
    * **THIS ONLY TELLS US HOW DATA POINTS ARE REPRESENTED, NOT THE TYPE OF PLOT**
* `geom`s (short for *geometries*) **DEFINE THE KIND OF PLOT WE PRODUCE**
    * Showing the data **as points** is a *scatterplot*
    * Showing the data **as lines** is a *line plot*
    * Showing the data **as bars** is a *barchart*
* We can use **different `geom`s with the *same data and aesthetics* **

----

**SLIDE: What is a Plot? `geom`s**

* **DEMO IN SCRIPT** (`gapminder.R`)
    * We **create a plot with the `ggplot()` function**.
    * We define the *data* as `data`, and *aesthetics* with `aes`
    * **WE PUT THE RESULT IN A VARIABLE FOR CONVENIENCE**
    * *Data* and *aesthetics* aren't enough to define a plot. **WE NEED A `geom`**
    * Use `geom_point()`

```R
# Generate plot of GDP per capita against life Expectancy
p <- ggplot(data=gapminder, aes(x=lifeExp, y=gdpPercap, color=continent))
p + geom_point()
```

* **WE'VE RECREATED THE SCATTERPLOT WE SAW EARLIER**
* **COMMIT CHANGES TO SCRIPT**

* **What happens if we change the `geom`?**
* **DEMO IN THE SCRIPT**

```R
p + geom_line()
```

* This looks terrible. **CHANGE IT BACK**

----

**SLIDE: Challenge 15**

```R
#Â Plot life expectancy against time
p <- ggplot(data=gapminder, aes(x=year, y=lifeExp, colour=continent))
p + geom_point()
```

![images/red_green_sticky.png](images/red_green_sticky.png)

----

**SLIDE: What is a Plot? *layers* **

* Without knowing it, **WE'VE JUST BEEN USING THE LAYERS CONCEPT**
    * **all `ggplot2` plots are built as layers**

* **ALL LAYERS HAVE TWO COMPONENTS**
    * *data* to be shown, and *aesthetics* for showing them
    * a `geom` defining the type of plot

* **The `ggplot` object describes a *base* layer, and can contain *data* and *aesthetics* **
    * **THESE ARE INHERITED BY THE OTHER LAYERS IN THE PLOT**
    * **The values can also be overridden in specified layers**

----

**SLIDE: What is a Plot? *layers* **

* In our first plot we defined a *base* with:
    * *data* from `gapminder`
    * *aesthetics* with *x* and *y* coordinates, and colouring by continent
* We defined a layer that:
    * had a `geom_point` `geom`
    * inherited *data* and *aesthetics* from the *base*

**LAYERS ARE ADDED WITH THE `+` OPERATOR**    

----

**SLIDE: What is a Plot? *layers* **

* Now we will **override the base layer *aesthetics* **
* **DEMO IN SCRIPT**
    * We'll **change the `geom`** to `geom_line`
    * We'll extend the *aesthetics* to **group datapoints by country**

```R
# Generate plot of GDP per capita against life expectancy
p <- ggplot(data=gapminder, aes(x=lifeExp, y=gdpPercap, color=continent))
p + geom_line(aes(group=country))
```

* **RENDER THE PLOT**

----

**SLIDE: What is a Plot? *layers* **

* We can **BUILD UP LAYERS OF `geom`S** to produce a more complex plot
* We **ADD A NEW `geom_point()` LAYER WITH `+`**
    * We use the layer's `alpha` argument to control transparency
* **DEMO IN SCRIPT**

```R
# Generate plot of GDP per capita against life expectancy
p <- ggplot(data=gapminder, aes(x=lifeExp, y=gdpPercap, color=continent))
p + geom_line(aes(group=country)) + geom_point(alpha=0.4)
```

* **RENDER THE PLOT**
* **COMMIT THE CHANGES**

----

**SLIDE: Challenge 16**

```R
# Generate plot of life expectancy against time
p <- ggplot(data=gapminder, aes(x=year, y=lifeExp, color=continent))
p + geom_line(aes(group=country)) + geom_point(alpha=0.35)
```

![images/red_green_sticky.png](images/red_green_sticky.png)

----

**SLIDE: Transformations and `scale`s**

* Another kind of layer is a *transformation* - handled with `scale` layers
* These map *data* to new aesthetics on the plot
    * new axis scales, e.g. log scale, reverse scale, time scale
    * colour scaling (changing palettes)
    * shape and size scaling

* **DEMO IN SCRIPT** (`gapminder.R`)
   * Rescale the plot first
   * Then change the colours

```R
# Generate plot of GDP per capita against life expectancy
p <- ggplot(data=gapminder, aes(x=lifeExp, y=gdpPercap, color=continent))
p <- p + geom_line(aes(group=country)) + geom_point(alpha=0.4)
p + scale_y_log10() + scale_color_grey()
```

----

**SLIDE: Statistics layers**

* Some `geom` layers transform the dataset
   * Usually this is a data summary (e.g. smoothing or binning)
   * The layer **may provide a new summary visual object**

* **DEMO IN SCRIPT**
   *  This is working towards an informative figure
   *  **Start with a new basic scatterplot**
   *  **NOTE:** setting opacity helps see density in the data - **looks like two main points of density**
   *  **NOTE:** looks like a general trend of GDP and life expectancy correlating

```R
# Generate summary plot of GDP per capita against life expectancy
p <- ggplot(data=gapminder, aes(x=lifeExp, y=gdpPercap))
p + geom_point(alpha=0.4) + scale_y_log10()
```

* **ADD A SMOOTHED FIT**
   * **NOTE:** The correlation is made quite clear

```R
# Generate summary plot of GDP per capita against life expectancy
p <- ggplot(data=gapminder, aes(x=lifeExp, y=gdpPercap))
p <- p + geom_point(alpha=0.4) + scale_y_log10()
p + geom_smooth()
```

* **ADD A CONTOUR PLOT OF DENSITY**
    * **NOTE:** Two populations are clear
    * **We might speculate that there is a difference in wealth/life expectancy across continents**

```R
# Generate summary plot of GDP per capita against life expectancy
p <- ggplot(data=gapminder, aes(x=lifeExp, y=gdpPercap))
p <- p + geom_point(alpha=0.4) + scale_y_log10()
p + geom_density_2d(color="purple")
```

* **ADD CONTINENT COLOURING**
    * **NOTE:** It's now clear that the two populations are centred on Europe (wealthy, long-lived) and Africa (poor, short-lived), respectively.

```R
p <- ggplot(data=gapminder, aes(x=lifeExp, y=gdpPercap))
p <- p + geom_point(alpha=0.4, aes(color=continent)) + scale_y_log10()
p + geom_density_2d(color="purple")
```

* **COMMIT CHANGES**

----

**SLIDE: Multi-panel figures**

* All our plots so far have been single figures, but **multi-panel plots can give clearer comparisons**
* The **`facet_wrap()` layer allows us to make grids of plots, SPLIT BY A FACTOR**
* **DEMO IN THE SCRIPT**
    * We set a **default aesthetic grouping by country**
    * We generate a line plot, with log y axis
    * **The result is a bit messy.**

```R
# Compare life expectancy over time by country
p <- ggplot(data=gapminder, aes(x=year, y=lifeExp, colour=continent, group=country))
p + geom_line() + scale_y_log10()
```

* **using `facet_wrap()` to split by continent is clearer**
    * **NOTE:** the axes are consistent across facets

```R
p <- ggplot(data=gapminder, aes(x=year, y=lifeExp, colour=continent, group=country))
p <- p + geom_line() + scale_y_log10()
p + facet_wrap(~continent)
```

# 08. Working with `data.frame`s in `dplyr`

----

**SLIDE: Learning Objectives**

* You're going to **learn to manipulate `data.frame`s with the six *verbs* of `dplyr`**

* `select()`
* `filter()`
* `group_by()`
* `summarize()`
* `mutate()`
* `%>%` (pipe)

----

**SLIDE: What and Why is `dplyr`?**

* `dplyr` is a package in the **TIDYVERSE**; it exists to enable **rapid analysis of data by groups**
   * For example, if we wanted numerical (rather than graphical) analysis of the `gapminder` data by continent, we'd use `dplyr`
* So far, we know how to **subset, but repetitive application is tedious**
   * **WE MIGHT MANAGE TO REPEAT BY CONTINENT, LIKE HERE - BUT *BY COUNTRY*?**

* **AVOIDING REPETITION IMPROVES YOUR CODE**
    * More **robust**
    * More **readable**
    * More **reproducible**

----

**SLIDE: Split-Apply-Combine**

* The **general principle** `dplyr` supports is **SPLIT-APPLY-COMBINE**

* We have a **dataset with several groups** (column `x`)
* We **want to perform the same operation on each group, independently** - take a mean of `y` for each group, for example
    * So we **SPLIT** the data into groups, on `x`
    * Then we **APPLY** the operation (take the mean for each group)
    * Then we **COMBINE** the results into a new table

----

**SLIDE: `select()` - Interactive Demo**

* **DEMO IN CONSOLE**
    * Import `dplyr`

```R
> library(dplyr)
```

* The `select()` *verb* **SELECTS COLUMNS**
    * **DEMO IN CONSOLE**
    * If we wanted to select only year, country and GDP data from `gapminder`
    * Specify: **data, then columns**

```R
> head(select(gapminder, year, country, gdpPercap))
  year     country gdpPercap
1 1952 Afghanistan  779.4453
2 1957 Afghanistan  820.8530
3 1962 Afghanistan  853.1007
4 1967 Afghanistan  836.1971
5 1972 Afghanistan  739.9811
6 1977 Afghanistan  786.1134
```

* Here, we **applied a function**, but we can also **'PIPE' DATA FROM ONE VERB TO ANOTHER**
    * These work **like pipes in the shell**
    * **SPECIAL PIPE SYMBOL: `%>%`**
    * Specify **only columns**

```R
> head(gapminder %>% select(year, country, gdpPercap))
  year     country gdpPercap
1 1952 Afghanistan  779.4453
2 1957 Afghanistan  820.8530
3 1962 Afghanistan  853.1007
4 1967 Afghanistan  836.1971
5 1972 Afghanistan  739.9811
6 1977 Afghanistan  786.1134
```

----

**SLIDE: `filter()`**

* `filter()` selects rows on the basis of some condition, or combination of conditions
    * We can **use it as a function, with *pipes* **

* **DEMO IN CONSOLE**

```R
> head(filter(gapminder, continent=="Europe"))
  country year     pop continent lifeExp gdpPercap
1 Albania 1952 1282697    Europe   55.23  1601.056
2 Albania 1957 1476505    Europe   59.28  1942.284
3 Albania 1962 1728137    Europe   64.82  2312.889
4 Albania 1967 1984060    Europe   66.22  2760.197
5 Albania 1972 2263554    Europe   67.69  3313.422
6 Albania 1977 2509048    Europe   68.93  3533.004
```

* **DEMO IN SCRIPT** (`gapminder.R`)
    * One **advantage of pipes** is that they make chaining *verbs* together **MORE READABLE**
    * **END THE LINES WITH THE PIPE SYMBOL** so `R` knows that there's a continuation
    * `Run` the lines and **check the output** in `Environment`
    * `Commit` the changes

```R
# Select gdpPercap by country and year, only for Europe
eurodata <- gapminder %>%
              filter(continent == "Europe") %>%
              select(year, country, gdpPercap)
```

* The `group_by()` *verb* **SPLITS `data.frame`s INTO GROUPS ON A COLUMN PROPERTY**
* **DEMO IN CONSOLE**
    * It returns a **`tibble`** - a table with extra metadata describing the groups in the table

```
> group_by(gapminder, continent)
# A tibble: 1,704 x 6
# Groups:   continent [5]
       country  year      pop continent lifeExp gdpPercap

**SLIDE: `summarize()`

* The **combination of `group_by()` and `summarize()` is very powerful**
    * We can **CREATE NEW VARIABLES** using functions that repeat for each group
* Here, we've split the original table into three groups, and now **CREATE A NEW VARIABLE `mean_b` THAT IS FILLED BY CALCULATING THE MEAN OF `b`**

* **DEMO IN SCRIPT**
    * We use the same principle to **calculate mean GDP per continent**

```R
> # Produce table of mean GDP by continent
> gapminder %>%
+     group_by(continent) %>%
+     summarize(meangdpPercap=mean(gdpPercap))
# A tibble: 5 x 2
  continent meangdpPercap
     <fctr>         <dbl>
1    Africa      2193.755
2  Americas      7136.110
3      Asia      7902.150
4    Europe     14469.476
5   Oceania     18621.609
```

**SLIDE: challenge 19**

* **IN THE SCRIPT**

```R
# Find average life expectancy by nation
avg_lifexp_country <- gapminder %>%
  group_by(country) %>%
  summarize(meanlifeExp=mean(lifeExp))
```

* **IN THE CONSOLE**

```
> avg_lifexp_country[avg_lifexp_country$meanlifeExp == max(avg_lifexp_country$meanlifeExp),]
# A tibble: 1 x 2

**SLIDE: `count()` and `n()`**

* Two other useful functions are related to `summarize()`
    * **`count()` reports a new table of counts by group**
    * **`n()` is used to represent the count of rows, when calculating new values in `summarize()`**

**DEMO IN CONSOLE**
    * **NOTE:** standard error is (std dev)/sqrt(n)

```R
> gapminder %>% filter(year == 2002) %>% count(continent, sort = TRUE)
# A tibble: 5 x 2
  continent     n
     <fctr> <int>
1    Africa    52
2      Asia    33
3    Europe    30
4  Americas    25
5   Oceania     2
> gapminder %>% group_by(continent) %>% summarize(se_lifeExp = sd(lifeExp)/sqrt(n()))
# A tibble: 5 x 2
  continent se_lifeExp
     <fctr>      <dbl>
1    Africa  0.3663016
2  Americas  0.5395389

5   Oceania  0.7747759
```

**SLIDE: `mutate()`**

* **`mutate()` CALCULATES NEW VARIABLES (COLUMNS) ON THE BASIS OF EXISTING COLUMNS**
* **DEMO IN SCRIPT**
    * Say we want to calculate the **total GDP of each nation, each year, in $bn**
    * We'd multiply the GDP per capita by the total population, and divide by 1bn
* **INSPECT THE OUTPUT**
    * We have a new data table, which is the `gapminder` data, plus an extra column

```R
# Calculate GDP in $billion
gdp_bill <- gapminder %>%
  mutate(gdp_billion = gdpPercap * pop / 10^9)
```

* **WE CAN CHAIN ALL THESE OPERATIONS TOGETHER WITH PIPES**
* **We can calculate several summaries in a single `summarize()` command**
* We can use the output of `mutate()` in the `summarize()` command
* **DEMO IN SCRIPT**
    * We're going to calculate the **total (and standard deviation) of GDP per continent, per year**
    * Calculate total GDP first
    * Group by continent and year
    * Summarise mean and sd of GDP per capita, and total GDP
 * **INSPECT THE OUTPUT**
 * `Commit` the changes

```R
# Calculate total/sd of GDP by continent and year
gdp_bycontinents_byyear <- gapminder %>%
  mutate(gdp_billion=gdpPercap*pop/10^9) %>%
  group_by(continent,year) %>%
  summarize(mean_gdpPercap=mean(gdpPercap),
            sd_gdpPercap=sd(gdpPercap),
            mean_gdp_billion=mean(gdp_billion),
            sd_gdp_billion=sd(gdp_billion))
```

# 09. Program Flow Control

----

**SLIDE: Learning Objectives**

* In this short section, you'll learn how to **perform actions depending on values of data** in `R`
* You'll also learn how to **repeat operations, using `for()` loops**
* **These are very important general concepts, that recur in many programming languages**
* Much of the time, you can avoid using them in `R` data analyses, because `dplyr` exists, and because `R` is **vectorised**

----

**SLIDE: `if()` â¦ `else`**

* We **often want to run a piece of code, or take an action, dependent on whether some data has a particular value (is true or false, say**
* When this is the case, we can use the general `if()` â¦ `else` structure, which is common to most programming languages

* **DEMO IN SCRIPT**
* **CREATE NEW SCRIPT** (`flow_control.R`)
    * Let's say that we want to print a message if some value is greater than 10
    * **NOTE AUTOCOMPLETION/BRACKETS ETC.**
    * **THE CODE TO BE RUN GOES IN CURLY BRACES**
    * `Source` the file
    * **NOTHING HAPPENS** (`x > 10` is `FALSE`)
    * The `if()` block executes **if the value in the parentheses evaluates to `TRUE`**

```R
# A data point
x <- 8

# Example if statement
if (x > 10) {
  print("x is greater than 10")
}
```

* **MODIFY THE SCRIPT**
    * Add the `else` block
    * `Source` the code: **we get a message**
    * **BUT IS THE MESSAGE TRUE?**

```R
# Example if statement
if (x > 10) {
  print("x is greater than 10")
} else {
  print("x is less than 10")
}
```

* **SET `x <- 10` AND TRY AGAIN**
* **MODIFY THE SCRIPT WITH `else if()` STATEMENT**
    * `Source` the script: **NO OUTPUT**

```R
# A data point
x <- 10

# Example if statement
if (x > 10) {
  print("x is greater than 10")
} else if (x < 10) {
  print("x is less than 10")
}
```

* **MODIFY THE SCRIPT WITH A FINAL `else` STATEMENT**
    * `Source` the script: **EQUALS** output

```R
# A data point
x <- 9

# Example if statement
if (x > 10) {
  print("x is greater than 10")
} else if (x < 10) {
  print("x is less than 10")
} else {
  print("x is equal to 10")
}
```

   print("Record(s) for this year found.")
}
```

**SLIDE: `for()` loops**

* If you want to iterate over a set of values, then `for()` loops can be used
* `for()` loops are **a very common programming construct**
* They express the idea: **FOR EACH ITEM IN A GROUP, DO SOMETHING (WITH THAT ITEM)**

* **DEMO IN SCRIPT** (`flow_control.R`)
    * Say we have a *vector* `c(1,2,3)`, and we want to print each item
    * We can **loop over all the items** and print them
* **The loop structure is**
    * `for()`, where the argument names a variable (`i`) - the *iterator*, and a set of values: **`for(i in c('a', 'b', 'c'))`**
    * A **CODE BLOCK** defined by curly braces (**note automated completion)
    * The **contents of the code block are executed for each value of the iterator**

```R
# Basic for loop
for(i in c('a', 'b', 'c')){
  print(i)
}
```

* **Loops can (but shouldn't always) be nested**
* **DEMO IN SCRIPT**
    * The outer loop is executed and, **for each value in the outer loop, the inner loop is executed to completion**

```R
# Nested loop example
for (i in 1:5) {
  for (j in c('a', 'b', 'c')) {
    print(paste(i, j))
  }
}
```

* The simplest way to capture output is to add a new item to a vector each iteration of the loop
* **DEMO IN SCRIPT**
    * **REMIND:** using `c()` to append to a vector

```R
# Capture loop output
output <- c()
for (i in 1:5) {
  for (j in c('a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e')) {
    output <- c(output, paste(i, j))
  }
}
(output)
``` 

* **GROWING OUTPUT FROM LOOPS IS COMPUTATIONALLY VERY EXPENSIVE**
    * Better to define the empty output container first (**if you know the dimensions**)
* **MODIFY IN SCRIPT**

```R
# Capture loop output
output_matrix <- matrix(nrow=5, ncol=5)
j_letters <- c('a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e')
for (i in 1:5) {
  for (j in 1:5) {
    output_matrix[i, j] <-paste(i, j_letters[j])
  }
}
(output_matrix)
```

----

**SLIDE: `while()` loops**

* Sometimes you need to perform some action **WHILE A CONDITION IS TRUE**
    * This isn't as common as a `for()` loop
    * It's a **general programming construct**

* **DEMO IN SCRIPT**
    * We'll **generate random numbers until one falls below a threshold**
    * `runif()` generates random numbers from a uniform distribution
    * We print random numbers until one is less than 0.1
* **run a couple of times to show the output is random**

```R
# Example while loop
z <- 1
while(z > 0.1){
  z <- runif(1)
  print(z)
}
```

* **COMMIT THE SCRIPT**

**SLIDE: Challenge 21**

```R
# Challenge solution
for (l in letters) {
  if (l %in% c('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u')) {
    value <- TRUE
  } else {
    value <- FALSE
  }
  print(paste(l, value))
}
```

**SLIDE: Vectorisation**

* Although `for()` and `while()` loops can be useful, they are **rarely the most efficient way to work in `R`**
* **MOST FUNCTIONS IN `R` ARE VECTORISED**
    * **When applied to a vector, they work on all elements in the vector**
    * So no need to use a loop.

* **DEMO IN CONSOLE**
    * **Operators** are vectorised

```R
> x <- 1:4
> x
[1] 1 2 3 4
> x * 2
[1] 2 4 6 8
```

* **You can operate on vectors together**

```R
> y <- 6:9
> y
[1] 6 7 8 9
> x + y
[1]  7  9 11 13
> x * y
[1]  6 14 24 36
```

* **Comparison operators are vectorised**

```R
> x > 2
[1] FALSE FALSE  TRUE  TRUE
> y < 7
[1]  TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE
> any(y < 7)
[1] TRUE
> all(y < 7)
[1] FALSE
```

* **Functions working on vectors**

```R
> log(x)
[1] 0.0000000 0.6931472 1.0986123 1.3862944
> x^2
[1]  1  4  9 16
> sin(x)
[1]  0.8414710  0.9092974  0.1411200 -0.7568025
```

* **MATRICES**
    * The `*` multiplication operator is a vectorised/elementwise multiplication
    * **To perform the matrix multiplication you might expect, use the `%*%` operator**

```R
> m <- matrix(1:4, nrow = 2, ncol = 2)
> m
     [,1] [,2]
[1,]    1    3
[2,]    2    4
> m * m
     [,1] [,2]
[1,]    1    9
[2,]    4   16
> m %*% m
     [,1] [,2]
[1,]    7   15
[2,]   10   22

# 10. Functions

----

* **SLIDE: Learning objectives**

* **YOU'VE ALREADY BEEN USING FUNCTIONS (e.g. `log()`)** and, I hope, have found them useful
* Functions let us run a complex series of commands in one go
    * **You wouldn't want to have to repeat the calculations for `log()` each time**
    * They keep the operation under a memorable or descriptive name, **which makes the code readable and understandable**, and they are invoked with that name
    * There are a **defined set of inputs and outputs** for a function, so **WE KNOW WHAT BEHAVIOUR TO EXPECT**

----

* **SLIDE: Why Functions?**

* Functions let us **run a complex series of logically- or functionally-RELATED commands in one go**
* It helps when functions have **descriptive and memorable names**, as this makes code **READABLE AND UNDERSTANDABLE**
* We invoke functions with their name
* We **expect functions to have A DEFINED SET OF INPUTS AND OUTPUTS** - aids clarity and understanding

* **FUNCTIONS ARE THE BUILDING BLOCKS OF PROGRAMMING**

* As a **rule of thumb** it is good to write small functions with one obvious, clearly-defined task.
    * As you will see **we can chain smaller functions together to manage complexity**

----

* **SLIDE: Defining a Function**

* Functions have a **STANDARD FORM**
    * We **declare a `<function_name>`**
    * We use the `function` *function*/keyword to assign the function to `<function_name>`
    * Inputs (*arguments*) to a function are defined in parentheses: **These are defined as variables for use within the function AND DO NOT EXIST OUTSIDE THE FUNCTION**
    * The code block (**curly braces**) encloses the function code, the *function body*.
    * **NOTE THE INDENTATION** - *Easier to read, but does not affect execution*
    * The code `<does_something>`
    * The `return()` function returns the value, when the function is called

* **DEMO IN SCRIPT**
    * **Create new script `functions.R`**
    * Write and `Source`

```R
# Example function
my_sum <- function(a, b) {
  the_sum <- a + b
  return(the_sum)
}
```

* **DEMO IN CONSOLE**

```R
> my_sum(3, 7)
[1] 10
> a
Error: object 'a' not found
> b
Error: object 'b' not found
```

* **DEMO IN SCRIPT**
    * Let's define another function: convert temperature from fahrenheit to Kelvin

```R
# Fahrenheit to Kelvin
fahr_to_kelvin <- function(temp) {
  kelvin <- ((temp - 32) * (5 / 9)) + 273.15
  return(kelvin)
}
```

* **DEMO IN SCRIPT**

```R
> fahr_to_kelvin(32)
[1] 273.15
> fahr_to_kelvin(-40)
[1] 233.15
> fahr_to_kelvin(212)
[1] 373.15
> temp
Error: object 'temp' not found
```

* **LET'S MAKE ANOTHER FUNCTION CONVERTING KELVIN TO CELSIUS**
* **DEMO IN SCRIPT**
    * `Source` the script

```R
# Kelvin to Celsius
kelvin_to_celsius <- function(temp) {
  celsius <- temp - 273.15
  return(celsius)
}
```

* **DEMO IN CONSOLE**

```R
> kelvin_to_celsius(273.15)
[1] 0
> kelvin_to_celsius(233.15)
[1] -40
> kelvin_to_celsius(373.15)
[1] 100
```

* **WE COULD DEFINE A NEW FUNCTION TO CONVERT FAHRENHEIT TO CELSIUS**
    * **But it's easier to combine the two functions we've already written**

* **DEMO IN CONSOLE**

```R
> fahr_to_kelvin(212)
[1] 373.15
> kelvin_to_celsius(fahr_to_kelvin(212))
[1] 100
```

* **DEMO IN SCRIPT**

```R
# Fahrenheit to Celsius
fahr_to_celsius <- function(temp) {
  celsius <- kelvin_to_celsius(fahr_to_kelvin(temp))
  return(celsius)
}
```

* **DEMO IN CONSOLE**
    * **NOTE: AUTOMATICALLY TAKES ADVANTAGE OF `R`'s VECTORISATION**

```R
> fahr_to_celsius(212)
[1] 100
> fahr_to_celsius(32)
[1] 0
> fahr_to_celsius(-40)
[1] -40
> fahr_to_celsius(c(-40, 32, 212))
[1] -40   0 100
```

----

**SLIDE: Documentation**

* It's important to have well-named functions (this is itself a form of documentation)
* But it's **not a detailed explanation**

* You've found `R`'s help useful, but it doesn't exist for your functions until you write it
* **YOUR FUTURE SELF WILL THANK YOU FOR DOING IT!**

* **SOME GOOD PRINCIPLES TO FOLLOW WHEN WRITING DOCUMENTATION ARE:**
    * Say what the code does (and why) - *more important than **how** *
    * Define your inputs and outputs
    * Provide an example

* **DEMO IN CONSOLE**

```R
> ?fahr_to_celsius
No documentation for âfahr_to_celsiusâ in specified packages and libraries:
you could try â??fahr_to_celsiusâ
> ??fahr_to_celsius
```

* **DEMO IN SCRIPT**
    * We add documentation as comment strings in the function
    * **SOURCE** the script

```R
# Fahrenheit to Celsius
fahr_to_celsius <- function(temp) {
  # Convert input temperature from fahrenheit to celsius scale
  #
  # temp        - numeric 
  #
  # Example:
  # > fahr_to_celsius(c(-40, 32, 212))
  # [1] -40   0 100
  celsius <- kelvin_to_celsius(fahr_to_kelvin(temp))
  return(celsius)
}
```

* **DEMO IN CONSOLE**
    * We read the documentation by providing the function name **only**

```R
> fahr_to_celsius
function(temp) {
  # Convert input temperature from fahrenheit to celsius scale
  #
  # temp        - numeric 
  #
  # Example:
  # > fahr_to_celsius(c(-40, 32, 212))
  # [1] -40   0 100
  celsius <- kelvin_to_celsius(fahr_to_kelvin(temp))
  return(celsius)
}
```

# 11. Dynamic Reports

----

**SLIDE: Learning Objectives**

* In this final section, we'll be learning how to **create reproducible, attractive, dynamic reports**
* To do so, we'll learn some **markdown syntax**, and how to put **working R code** into a document
* We'll also look at **generating the report in a number of file formats**, for sharing.

----

**SLIDE: Literate Programming**

* What we're about to do is an example of **Literate Programming**, a concept introduced by Donald Knuth
* The idea of Literate Programming is that
    * **The program or analysis is explained in natural language**
    * **The code needed to run the program/analysis is embedded in the document**
    * **The whole document is executable**

* We can produce these documents in `RStudio`

----

**SLIDE: Create an `R Markdown` file**

* In `R`, literate programming is **implemented in `R Markdown` files
* To create one: **`File` $\rightarrow$ `New File` $\rightarrow$ `R Markdown`**
    * There is a dialog box - **enter a title** (`Literate Programming`)
    * Save the file (`Ctrl-S`) - **create new subdirectory (`markdown`)** - `literate_programming.Rmd`
* The file **gets the extension `.Rmd`**
    * The **file is autopopulated with example text**

**SLIDE: Components of an `R Markdown` file**

* The **HEADER REGION IS FENCED BY `---`**
    * **Metadata** (author, title, date)
    * Requested **output format**

```R

```

* Natural language is written as plain text, **with some extra characters to define formatting**
    * **NOTE THE HASHES `#`, ASTERISKS `*` AND ANGLED BRACKETS `<>`**
* `R` code runs in the document, and is **fenced by backticks**

* **CLICK ON `KNIT`**

**SLIDE: Creating a Report**

* We'll **create a report on the `gapminder` data**

* **DELETE THE EXISTING TEXT/CODE CHUNKS** (`literate_programming.Rmd`)
    * **Change the title** (`Life Expectancies`)
    * **Define the input data location in the `setup` section**
        * Code in the `setup` section is run, but not shown (**knit to demo**)
        * `include = FALSE`
    * **Write introduction and KNIT**
        * Header notation with the hash `#`
        * Inline `R` to name the data used
        * **We can define the location of the data in one place, and reuse the variable/have it propagate when we update the data**
        * Import the data in `setup`
    * **Write next section** (`Life expectancy in countries`)
        * `Source` the `functions.R` file to get our solution to Challenge 23 (`plotLifeExp`)
        * Use the imported function
        * `{r echo=FALSE}` shows output but not the code
    * **Change the letters**
        * Change the letters to something else
        * Re-run the document
    * **Add Numbered Table of Contents (where possible)**
        * Make the required changes in the header

# Letters to report on
az <- c('G', 'Y', 'R')

# Load gapminder data
gapminder <- read.csv(datapath, sep=",", header=TRUE)

# Source functions from earlier lesson
source("../scripts/functions.R")
```

# Introduction

We will present the life expectancies over time in a set of countries, using the gapminder data in the file `r datapath`.

We will specifically focus on countries beginning with the letters: `r az`.

# Life expectancy in `r az` countries

In countries starting with these letters, the life expectancy is as plotted below.

We use the code from our earlier challenge solution

```{r plot_function}
plotLifeExp
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
plotLifeExp(gapminder, az, wrap=TRUE)
```

```
