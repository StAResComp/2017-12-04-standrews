## TITLE

* Programming in `R`: Part One

## ETHERPAD

* Please use the Etherpad for the course

## SECTION 01: Introduction to `R` and `RStudio`

**SLIDE: Learning Objectives**

* We're going to talk in general terms about **WHAT `R` and `RSTUDIO` are**.
* We're also going to discuss **WHAT MAKES THEM DIFFERENT FROM SOME OTHER TOOLS** you might already use for similar tasks, like `Excel`

----

**SLIDE: What is `R`?**

* `R` is a **PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE**, and the **SOFTWARE** that runs programs written in that language.
* `R` is **AVAILABLE ON ALL PLATFORMS**
* This can sometimes be confusing - **IF AT ANY POINT I AM UNCLEAR, PLEASE ASK!**

* **HAS ANYONE IN THE ROOM USED `R` BEFORE? - GREEN STICKY**
    * If anyone has used `R`, please could you be available to help one of your neighbours who has not, if they have any questions. Look around you - if there's someone nearby with a green sticky, say 'hi'!

* **WHY USE OR TEACH `R`?**
    * `R` is **FREE**, and very **WIDELY-USED** across a range of disciplines.
    * There are **MANY USEFUL PACKAGES** or data analysis and statistics
    * It has excellent **GRAPHICS CAPABILITIES**
    * There is an international, friendly **COMMUNITY** across a range of disciplines, so it's easy to find local and online support

----

**SLIDE: But I already know `Excel`**

* I'm **NOT HERE TO CRITICISE `EXCEL`**. `Excel` is brilliant at what it's meant to do. It's **POWERFUL** and **INTUITIVE**.
* But **`R` HAS MANY ADVANTAGES FOR REPRODUCIBLE AND COMPLEX ANALYSIS**

* A key thing for reproducibility is that it **SEPARATES DATA FROM ANALYSIS**.
    * In `R`, when you do anything to the original data, that original data remains unmodified (unless you overwrite the file).
    * **POINT OF GOOD PRACTICE: RAW DATA SHOULD BE READ-ONLY**
    * In `Excel` however it's easy to overwrite data with copy-and-paste (and many bad things have happened as a result) - see Mike Croucher's talk for examples.

* Because **YOUR ANALYSIS IN `R` IS A PROGRAM**, every step is written down explicitly, and is transparent and understandable by someone else.
    * In `Excel`, there is no clear record of where you moved your mouse, or what you copied and pasted, and it's not immediately obvious how your formulas work.

* `R` code is **EASY TO SHARE AND ADAPT**, and to apply again to a different or a modified input dataset. It's easy to publish the analyses via online resources, such as GitHub.
* `R` code can also be **RUN ON EXTREMELY LARGE DATASETS**, quickly. That's much harder in `Excel`.

----

**SLIDE: What is `RStudio`?**

* `RStudio` is an **INTEGRATED DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT** - which is to say it's a very powerful tool for writing and using `R` and programs in the `R` language.
    * It's available on **ALL PLATFORMS**
    * It's available as a webserver, too.

* On the left is a screenshot **WHILE I WAS WRITING THIS PRESENTATION IN RSTUDIO** on a Mac
* On the right is the Windows version, with an **EXAMPLE ANALYSIS AND VISUALISATION**

* You can use it to **INTERACT WITH `R` DIRECTLY TO EXPERIMENT WITH DATA**
* It has a **CODE/SCRIPT EDITOR FOR WRITING PROGRAMS**
* It has tools for **VISUALISING DATA**
* It has built-in **GIT INTEGRATION FOR MANAGING YOUR PROJECTS**

##Â SECTION 02: Getting To Know `RStudio`

**SLIDE: Learning Objectives**

* We need to get some **FAMILIARITY WITH OUR WORKING ENVIRONMENT**: the `RStudio` IDE
* Develop some **BEST PRACTICES FOR PROJECT MANAGEMENT** in general, and in `RStudio`
* We'll **BUILD UPON THE `GIT` LESSON** because `RStudio` integrates naturally with `git` to keep all your analysis and code under version control.
* We'll introduce `R` syntax, and **SEE HOW `R` REPRESENTS DATA** and how to **PROGRAM IN `R`**
* If we have time we'll deal with **MANAGING SOME OF THE MANY USEFUL PACKAGES** available in `R`

----

**SLIDE: `RStudio` overview - Interactive Demo**

* **START `RStudio`** (click icon/go into start menu and select RStudio/etc.)
    * **CHECK EVERYONE CAN START `RSTUDIO`**

![images/red_green_sticky.png](images/red_green_sticky.png)

* **REMIND PEOPLE THEY CAN USE RED/GREEN STICKIES AT ANY TIME**
* You should see **THREE PANELS**
    * Interactive `R` console: **you can type here and get instant feedback**
    * Environment/History window
    * Files/Plots/Packages/Help/Viewer: **interacting with files on the computer, and viewing help and some output**

* We're going to use `R` in the interactive console to get used to some of the features of the language, and `RStudio`. **DEMO CODE: ASK PEOPLE TO TYPE ALONG**
    * **THE RIGHT ANGLED BRACKET IS A PROMPT: `R` EXPECTS INPUT**
    * **TYPE THE CALCULATION, THEN PRESS RETURN**

```R
> 1 + 100
[1] 101
> 30 / 3
[1] 10
```

* **RESULT IS INDICATED WITH A NUMBER `[1]`** this indicates the line with output in it
* If you type an **INCOMPLETE COMMAND**, `R` will wait for you to complete it
    * **DEMO CODE**

```R
> 1 +
+ 
```

* The **PROMPT CHANGES TO `+` WHEN `R` EXPECTS MORE INPUT**
* You can either complete the line, or use `Esc` (`Ctrl-C`) to exit

```R
> 1 +
+ 6
[1] 7
> 1 + 
+ 

> 
```

* `R` obeys the usual **PRECEDENCE OPERATIONS** ( `(`, `**`/`^`, `/`, `*`, `+`, `-`)
    * **DEMO CODE: NOTE SPACES AROUND OPERATORS**

```R
> 3 + 5 * 2
[1] 13
> (3 + 5) * 2
[1] 16
> 3 + 5 * 2 ^ 2
[1] 23
> 3 + 5 * (2 ^ 2)
[1] 23
```

* **ARROW KEYS RECOVER OLD COMMANDS**
* **THE `HISTORY` TAB SHOWS ALL COMMANDS USED**
* `R` will report in **SCIENTIFIC NOTATION**
    * **CHECK THAT EVERYONE KNOWS WHAT SCIENTIFIC NOTATION IS**

![images/red_green_sticky.png](images/red_green_sticky.png)

```R
> 2 / 1000
[1] 0.002
> 2 / 10000
[1] 2e-04
> 5e3
[1] 5000
```

* `R` has many **STANDARD MATHEMATICAL FUNCTIONS**
* **FUNCTION SYNTAX**
     * type the function name
     * open parentheses
     * type input value
     * close parentheses
     * press return
     * **DEMO CODE**

```R
> sin(1)
[1] 0.841471
> log(1)
[1] 0
> log10(10)
[1] 1
> log(10)
[1] 2.302585
```

* How do we learn more about a function, or the difference between `log()` and `log10()`?
* **USE `R` BUILT-IN HELP**
    * Type `?` then the function name
    * Scroll to the bottom of the page to find example code

```R
> ?log
```

* This brings up help in the **HELP WINDOW**
* You can also use the **SEARCH BOX** at the top of the help window (try `sin()`)
* If you're not sure about spelling, the editor has **AUTOCOMPLETION** which will suggest all possible endings for something you type (try `log`) - **USE TAB TO SEE AUTOCOMPLETIONS**

* We can do **COMPARISONS** in `R`
    * Comparisons return `TRUE` or `FALSE`. **DEMO CODE**
    * **NOTE:** when comparing numbers, it's better to use `all.equal()` (*machine numeric tolerance*) **ASK IF THERE'S ANYONE FROM MATHS/PHYSICS**

```R
> 1 == 1
[1] TRUE
> 1 != 2
[1] TRUE
> 1 < 2
[1] TRUE
> 1 <= 1
[1] TRUE
> 1 > 0
[1] TRUE
> 1 >= -9
[1] TRUE
> all.equal(1.0, 1.0)
[1] TRUE
> all.equal(1.0, 1.1)
[1] "Mean relative difference: 0.1"
> all.equal(pi-1e-7, pi)
[1] "Mean relative difference: 3.183099e-08"
> all.equal(pi-1e-8, pi)
[1] TRUE
> pi-1e-8 == pi
[1] FALSE
```

**SLIDE: Challenge 01**

![images/red_green_sticky.png](images/red_green_sticky.png)

**SLIDE: Variables**

* **VARIABLES** are critical to programming in general, and also to working in `R`
* Variables are like **NAMED BOXES**
    * Like a box, they **HOLD THINGS**
    * When we make reference to a box's name, we **MEAN THE THING THE BOX CONTAINS**
* Here, the box is called `Name`, and it contains the word `Samia`
* When we refer to the box, we call it `Name`, and we might ask questions like:
    * "What is the length of `Name`?", meaning "What is the length of the word in the box called `Name`?" (answer: 5)

----

**SLIDE: Variables - Interactive Demo**

* This is a very important concept, so we're going to go through some practical examples, to reinforce it
    * In `R`, variables are assigned with the **ASSIGNMENT OPERATOR** `<-`
    * We will assign the value `1/40` to the variable `x`
    * **DEMO CODE**

```R
> x <- 1 / 40
```

* At first, nothing seems to happen, but we can see that the variable `x` now exists, and contains the value `0.025` - a **DECIMAL APPROXMATION** of the fraction `1/40`

```R
> x
[1] 0.025
```

* **CLICK ON THE ENVIRONMENT WINDOW**
    * You should see that `x` is defined, there
* The *Environment* window in `RStudio` tells you the name and content of every variable currently active in your `R` session.

* This **VARIABLE CAN BE USED ANYWHERE THAT EXPECTS A NUMBER**
    * such as an argument to a function

```R
> log(x)
[1] -3.688879
> sin(x)
[1] 0.0249974
> x + x
[1] 0.05
> 2 * x
[1] 0.05
> x ^ 2
[1] 0.000625
```

* We can **REASSIGN VALUES TO VARIABLES**
    * **MONITOR THE VALUE OF `x` IN THE ENVIRONMENT WINDOW**
    * We can also assign a variable to itself, to modify the variable

```R
> x <- 100
> x <- x + 5
```

* We can assign **ANY KIND OF VALUE** to a variable
    * Including **STRINGS** - i.e. sets of characters

```R
> name <- "Samia"
> name
[1] "Samia"
```

* But **BE CAREFUL** - `R` is not always intuitive
    * Strings in particular may not work the way you expect

```R
> length(name)
[1] 1
> nchar(name)
[1] 5
```

----

**SLIDE: Removing Variables**

* To remove **ONE OR MORE SPECIFIED VARIABLES**, use `rm()`
    * **`ls()` IS A FUNCTION THAT LISTS VARIABLES** (like the Environment tab) 
    * **DEMO CODE**

```R
> x <- 1
> y <- 2
> z <- 3
> ls()
[1] "x" "y" "z"
> rm(x)
> ls()
[1] "y" "z"
> rm(y, z)
> ls()
character(0)
```



----

**SLIDE: Challenge 02**

Solution:

`mass <- 47.5`
This will give a value of 47.5 for the variable mass

`age <- 122`
This will give a value of 122 for the variable age

`mass <- mass * 2.3`
This will multiply the existing value of 47.5 by 2.3 to give a new value of 109.25 to the variable mass.

`age <- age - 20`
This will subtract 20 from the existing value of 122 to give a new value of 102 to the variable age.

**SLIDE: Good Project Management Practices**

* There is **NO SINGLE GOOD WAY TO ORGANISE A PROJECT**
    * It's important to find something that **WORKS FOR YOU**
    * But it's **ALSO IMPORTANT THAT IT WORKS FOR COLLABORATORS**
    * Some **PRINCIPLES MAKE THINGS EASIER FOR EVERYONE**

* Using a **SINGLE WORKING DIRECTORY PER PROJECT/ANALYSIS**
    * **NAME IT AFTER THE PROJECT**
    * **EASY TO PACKAGE UP** the whole directory and move it around, or share it - **OR PUBLISH ALONGSIDE YOUR PAPER**
    * **NO NEED TO HUNT AROUND THE WHOLE DISK** to find relevant or important files.
    * You can use **RELATIVE PATHS** that will always work, so long as you work within the project directory
* Treat your **RAW DATA AS READ-ONLY**
    * Establishes **PROVENANCE** and **ENABLES REANALYSIS**
    * Keep in **SEPARATE SUBFOLDER**
* **CLEAN THE DATA PROGRAMMATICALLY** (part of the analysis chain)
    * Remove/fill in null values, etc. - whatever is appropriate
    * **KEEP CLEANED DATA SEPARATE FROM RAW** - like food hygiene
* **GENERATED OUTPUT IS DISPOSABLE**
    * This means **ANYTHING GENERATED AUTOMATICALLY BY YOUR CODE/ANALYSIS**
    * If a file can be generated by scripts/code in your project, no need to put it under version control

----

**SLIDE: Example Directory Structure**

* This is **ONE WAY TO STRUCTURE YOUR WORKING DIRECTORY**
    * It's a good starting point, but something else might be more appropriate for your own work

* **`WORKING DIR/`** is the *root* directory of the project.
    * Everything related to the project (subdirectories of data, scripts and figures; `git` files; configuration files; notes to yourself; whatever)
* **`data/`** is a subdirectory for storing data
    * raw data only, or raw and intermediate data? **YOUR DECISION**
    * `data/raw`, `data/intermediate` - **USE SUBFOLDERS WHEN SENSIBLE**
* **`data_output/`** could be a place to write the analysis output (`.csv` files etc.)
* **`documents/`** is a place where notes, drafts, and explanatory text could be stored
* **`fig_output/`** could be a place to write graphical output of the analysis (keep separate from tables)
* **`scripts`** might be where you would choose to keep executable code that automates your analysis

* The important thing is that the structure is **SELF-EXPLANATORY WHERE POSSIBLE**

----

**SLIDE: Project Management in `RStudio`**

* `RStudio` **TRIES TO BE HELPFUL** and provides the 'Project' concept
    * Keeps **ALL PROJECT FILES IN A SINGLE DIRECTORY**
    * **INTEGRATES WITH `GIT`**
    * Enables switching between projects within `RStudio`
    * Keeps project histories

* **INTERACTIVE DEMO**

* **CREATE PROJECT**
* Click `File` -> `New Project`
    * Options for how we want to create a project: brand new in a new working directory; turn an existing directory into a project; or checkout a project from `GitHub` or some other repository
* Click `New Directory`
    * Options for various things we can do in `RStudio`. Here we want `New Project`
* Click `New Project`
    * We are asked for a directory name. **ENTER `swc-r-lesson`**
    * We are asked for a parent directory. **PUT YOURS ON THE DESKTOP; STUDENTS CAN CHOOSE ANYWHERE SENSIBLE**
    * **SELECT `Create a git repository`** - this will create and initialise a `git` repository, just for this project
* Click `Create Project`
* **YOU SHOULD SEE AN EMPTY-ISH `RSTUDIO` WINDOW**

* **INSPECT PROJECT ENVIRONMENT**
* First, **NOTE THE WINDOWS**: editor; environment; files
* **EDITOR** is empty
* **ENVIRONMENT** is empty
* **FILES** shows
    * **CURRENT WORKING DIRECTORY** (see breadcrumb trail)
    * **TWO FILES**: `*.Rproj` - information about your project; `.gitignore` - your project's `.gitignore` file (remember the `git` lesson?)
* **CLICK ON `GIT` TAB**
    * We see that the files are not yet added to the project (status is `?`)
    * **CHECK BOXES TO STAGE FILES**
    * **CLICK ON `DIFF` TO SEE CHANGES** (note colours, lines, etc.)
    * **CLICK ON `COMMIT` TO COMMIT CHANGES**
    * **WRITE COMMIT MESSAGE** (add .gitignore and R project files to repo)
    * **CLICK `COMMIT`** (explain message)

* **CREATE DIRECTORIES IN PROJECT**
* **Create directoris called `scripts` and `data`**
    * Click on `New Folder`
    * Enter directory name (`scripts`)
    * Note that the directory now exists in the `Files` tab (but not in the `git` tab, as the directory is empty)
    * Do the same for `data/`
* **NOTE THAT WE WILL NOW POPULATE THE DIRECTORY**

----

**SLIDE: Working in RStudio**

* `RStudio` offers **SEVERAL WAYS TO WRITE CODE**
    * We'll not see all of them today
    * You've seen **DIRECT INTERACTION IN THE CONSOLE** (entering variables)
    * `RStudio` also has an editor for writing scripts, notebooks, markdown documents, and Shiny applications (**EXPLAIN BRIEFLY**)
    * It can also be used to write plain text

* **INTERACTIVE DEMO OF `R` SCRIPT**

* Click on `File` -> `New File` -> `Text File`. **NOTE THAT THE EDITOR WINDOW OPENS**
* Enter the following text, and **EXPLAIN CSV**
    * plain text file
    * one row per line
    * column entries separated by commas
    * first row is header data
    * **NEEDS A BLANK LINE AT THE END**
    * **DATA DESCRIBES CATS**

```
coat,weight,likes_string
calico,2.1,1
black,5.0,0
tabby,3.2,1

```

* **SAVE THE FILE AS `data/feline_data.csv`**
    * Click on disk icon
    * Navigate to `data/` subdirectory
    * Enter filename `feline_data.csv`
* **NOTE CHANGES IN `GIT` TAB**
    * The `data` directory appears!
    * Click on `Staged` and **THE FILE APPEARS**
    * Click `Commit` and add a commit string, e.g. "add cat dataset"
* **CLOSE THE EDITOR FOR THAT FILE**

* Click on `File` -> `New File` -> `R Script`.
* **EXPLAIN COMMENTS** while entering the code below
    * **COMMENTS ANNOTATE YOUR CODE**: reminders for you, and information for others
* **EXPLAIN `read.csv()`**
    * `read.csv()` is a **FUNCTION** that reads data from a **CSV-FORMAT FILE** into a variable in `R`
 
```R
# Script for exploring data structures

# Load cat data as a dataframe
cats <- read.csv(file = "data/feline_data.csv")
```

* **SAVE THE SCRIPT**
   * Click on `File` -> `Save`
   * Navigate to the `scripts/` subdirectory
   * Enter filename `data_structures` (**EXTENSION IS AUTOMATICALLY APPLIED**)
**NOTE CHANGES IN `GIT` TAB**
   * The `scripts` directory appears!
   * Click on `Staged` and the file appears
   * Click on `Commit` and add a commit string, e.g. "add data structures script"
* **DO YOU SEE THE VARIABLE IN THE ENVIRONMENT?**
   * **NO** - because the code hasn't been executed, only written.

* **RUN THE SCRIPT**
   * Click on `Source` and **NOTE THIS RUNS THE WHOLE SCRIPT**
* Go to the `Environment` tab
   * **NOTE THE DATA WAS LOADED IN THE VARIABLE `cats`**
   * Note that there is a description of the data (3 obs. of 3 variables)
   * **CLICK ON THE VARIABLE AND NOTE THAT THE TABLE IS NOW VISIBLE** - this is helpful
   * **YOU CANNOT EDIT THE DATA IN THIS TABLE** - you can sort and filter, but not modify the data. This **ENFORCES GOOD PRACTICE** (compare to Excel).

**SLIDE: 03. A First Analysis in `RStudio`**

----

**SLIDE: Learning Objectives**

* We're going to cover some ways of loading data into an `R` project/analysis
* We'll **EXPLORE SOME FUNCTIONS FOR SUMMARISING DATA**
* Sometimes we want to use only a portion of our data, and we'll see some **WAYS OF INDEXING DATASETS**
* We'll also look at some ways to **PLOT DATA IN R**, using the built-in *base graphics*

----

**SLIDE: Our Task**

* We've got some medical data relating to a new treatment for arthritis
* There are some measurements of patient inflammation, taken over a period of days post-treatment for each patient
* We've been **ASKED TO PRODUCE A SUMMARY AND SOME GRAPHS**

* **DOWNLOAD THE FILE FROM THE LINK TO `data/`**
* **EXPLAIN THE LINK IS ON THE ETHERPAD PAGE** (no need to type!)
* **DEMO THIS**
    * **NOTE:** A new directory is created *within* `data`, called `data`. **THIS IS UNTIDY, SO LET'S CLEAN**
    * **COPY ALL FILES BEGINNING WITH `inflammation` TO THE PARENT FOLDER**
    * **THEN DELETE THE SUBFOLDER AND ZIP FILE**
    * **ADD THE DATA FILES TO THE REPO** (can shift-click, here)

* **CHECK EVERYONE'S READY TO PROCEED**

---- 

**SLIDE: Loading Data - Interactive Demo**

* We've already created some cat data manually, but **THIS IS UNUSUAL** - most data comes in the form of plain text files

**START DEMO**
* **INSPECT DATA IN FILES WINDOW**
    * Click on filename, and select `View File`
    * Note: **THERE IS NO HEADER** and **THERE ARE NO ROW NAMES**
    * Ask: **IS THIS WELL-FORMATTED DATA?**
    * I happen to know that there is **one row per patient, and the columns are days, in turn, post-treatment**, and **measurements are inflammation levels**
* **WHAT IS THE DATA TYPE**
    * Tabular, with **EACH COLUMN SEPARATED BY A COMMA**, so **CSV**
    * **IN THE CONSOLE** use `read.csv()` to read the data in
    * Note: **IF WE DON'T ASSIGN THE RESULT TO A VARIABLE WE JUST SEE THE DATA**
* **CREATE A NEW SCRIPT**
    * Click the **triangle next to the new document icon**
    * Add the code and **SAVE AS `scripts/inflammation`** (`RStudio` adds the extension)
    * See that the file appears in `Files` and `Git` windows

```R
# Preliminary analysis of inflammation in arthritis patients

# Load data (no headers, CSV)
data <- read.csv(file = "data/inflammation-01.csv", header = FALSE)
```

* **INSPECT THE DATA**
    * `Source` the script
    * Check the `Environment` window: 60 observations (patients) of 40 variables (days)
    * **CLICK ON `data`**
    * **COLUMN HEADERS ARE PROVIDED: `Vn`** for *variable n*
    * `dim()` - *dimensions* of data: rows X columns
    * `length()` - number of columns in the table
    * `ncol()` - number of columns in the table
    * `nrow()` - number of rows in the table

```R
> head(data, n = 2)
  V1 V2 V3 V4 V5 V6 V7 V8 V9 V10 V11 V12 V13 V14 V15 V16 V17 V18 V19 V20 V21 V22 V23 V24 V25 V26

**SLIDE: Indexing Data**

* We can refer to an element in our dataset by *indexing* it
    * We **LOCATE A SINGLE ELEMENT as `[row, column]` in square brackets**

```R
> ncol(data)
[1] 40
> data[1,1]
[1] 0
> data[50,1]
[1] 0
> data[50,20]
[1] 16
> data[30,20]
[1] 16
```

* To get a **RANGE OF VALUES**, use the `:` separator to mean 'to':

```R
> data[1:4, 1:4]   # rows 1 to 4; columns 1 to 4
  V1 V2 V3 V4
1  0  0  1  3
2  0  1  2  1
3  0  1  1  3
4  0  0  2  0
> data[30:32, 20:22]
   V20 V21 V22
30  16  14  15
31  16  13   7
32   9  19  15
```

* To get a **WHOLE ROW OR COLUMN**, leave that entry blank

```R
> data[5,]
  V1 V2 V3 V4 V5 V6 V7 V8 V9 V10 V11 V12 V13 V14 V15 V16 V17 V18 V19 V20 V21 V22 V23 V24 V25 V26
5  0  1  1  3  3  1  3  5  2   4   4   7   6   5   3  10   8  10   6  17   9  14   9   7  13   9
  V27 V28 V29 V30 V31 V32 V33 V34 V35 V36 V37 V38 V39 V40

**SLIDE: Repetitive Calculations - Interactive Demo**

* We might want to **CALCULATE MEAN INFLAMMATION FOR EACH PATIENT**, but doing it the way we've just seen is tedious and slow.
* Happily **COMPUTERS WERE INVENTED TO SAVE US THE HASSLE**
* We could automate this task in any of several ways available in `R`
    * What we'd like to do is **APPLY A FUNCTION TO EACH ROW**
    * `R` has an `apply()` function exactly for this
    * **IN THE CONSOLE**

```R
> apply(X = data, MARGIN = 1, FUN = mean)
 [1] 5.450 5.425 6.100 5.900 5.550 6.225 5.975 6.650 6.625 6.525 6.775 5.800 6.225 5.750 5.225
[16] 6.300 6.550 5.700 5.850 6.550 5.775 5.825 6.175 6.100 5.800 6.425 6.050 6.025 6.175 6.550
[31] 6.175 6.350 6.725 6.125 7.075 5.725 5.925 6.150 6.075 5.750 5.975 5.725 6.300 5.900 6.750
[46] 5.925 7.225 6.150 5.950 6.275 5.700 6.100 6.825 5.975 6.725 5.700 6.250 6.400 7.050 5.900
```

* **IN OUR ANALYSIS SCRIPT** we want to assign these values to a variable, and **ALSO CALCULATE AVERAGE BY DAY**
    * So long as we provide arguments in the correct order, **WE DON'T NEED TO PROVIDE ARGUMENT NAMES** - true for most `R` functions

```R
# Calculate average inflammation by patient and day
avg_inflammation_patient <- apply(X = data, MARGIN = 1, FUN = mean)
avg_inflammation_day <- apply(data, 2, mean)
```

* **RUN THE LINES**
    * Note that the values appear in the Environment tab
* Like many common operations, there's an `R` function that's a shortcut
    * **IN THE CONSOLE**

```R

**SLIDE: Base Graphics**

* We're doing all this work to try to **GAIN INSIGHT INTO OUR DATA**
* **VISUALISATION IS A KEY ROUTE TO INSIGHT**

* `R` has many graphics packages - some of which produce extremely beautiful images, or are tailored to a specific problem domain
* The built-in graphics are known as *base graphics*
* They may not be as pretty, or as immediately suited for all circumstances as some other packages, but they are still very powerful

**SLIDE: Plotting - Interactive Demo**

* **IN THE SCRIPT**
    * `R`'s **`plot()` FUNCTION IS GENERAL AND WORKS FOR MANY KINDS OF DATA**
    * **RUN EACH LINE IN TURN**
    * **NOTE WHERE PLOTS SHOW** (Plot window)
    * Opportunity to note: **VARIABLES HELP READABILITY**
    * **USE ARROW BUTTONS** to cycle through plots
    * **COMMIT CHANGES WHEN DONE**

```R
# Plot data summaries
# Average inflammation by patient
plot(avg_inflammation_patient)

# Average inflammation per day
plot(avg_inflammation_day)

# Maximum inflammation per day
max_inflammation_day <- apply(data, 2, max)
plot(max_inflammation_day)

# Minimum inflammation per day
plot(apply(data, 2, min))

# Show a historgram of average patient inflammation
hist(avg_inflammation_patient)
```

* **THE `hist()` FUNCTION PLOTS A HISTOGRAM OF INPUT DATA FREQUENCY/COUNT**
    * The choice of bin sizes/*breaks* could be improved
    * We need to **PROVIDE THE BOUNDARIES BETWEEN BINS**
    * **IN THE CONSOLE**

```R
hist(avg_inflammation_patient, breaks=c(5, 6, 7, 8))
```

* We'd have to **TYPE IN A LOT OF NUMBERS** to get smaller breaks, which is **SLOW**
    * The `seq()` function generates a sequence of numbers for us

```R
> seq(5, 8)
[1] 5 6 7 8
> hist(avg_inflammation_patient, breaks=seq(5, 8))
```

* We can **SET THE INTERVAL OF THE SEQUENCE**

```R
> seq(5, 8, by=0.2)
 [1] 5.0 5.2 5.4 5.6 5.8 6.0 6.2 6.4 6.6 6.8 7.0 7.2 7.4 7.6 7.8 8.0
> hist(avg_inflammation_patient, breaks=seq(5, 8, by=0.2))
``` 

* **IN THE SCRIPT**
    * Add a line with the histogram for average patient inflammation

```R
# Show a historgram of average patient inflammation
hist(avg_inflammation_patient, breaks=seq(5, 8, by=0.2))
```

* **IN THE SCRIPT**
   * Demonstrate changing the input file
   * **CHANGING FILENAME IN A SCRIPT IS QUICKER THAN RETYPING ALL THE COMMANDS**

**SLIDE: 04. Data Structures in `R`**

----

**SLIDE: Learning Objectives**

* In this section, you'll be learning about the data types in `R`: **WHAT DATA IS**
* You'll also be learning about the data *structures*: **WHAT DATA IS BUILT INTO - HOW IT IS ARRANGED**
* And you'll also learn how to find out what type/structure a particular piece of data has
* Putting it together, you'll see how `R`'s data types and structures relate to the types of data that you work with, yourself.

----

**SLIDE: Data Types and Structures in `R`**

* `R` is **MOSTLY USED FOR DATA ANALYSIS**
* `R` is set up with key, core data types designed to help you work with your own data
* A lot of the time, `R` focuses on tabular data (like our cat example)
* **INTERACTIVE DEMO**

* **SWITCH TO THE CONSOLE** (Establish that `cats` is available as a variable)
* If you type `cats`, you get a nice tabular representation of your data 

```R
> cats
    coat weight likes_string
1 calico    2.1            1
2  black    5.0            0
3  tabby    3.2            1
```

* **THINK ABOUT THE DATA TYPES** Are they all the same?
    * **NO** `coat` is text; `weight` is some real value (in kg or pounds, maybe), and `likes_string` looks like it should be `TRUE`/`FALSE`
    * **DOES IT MAKE SENSE TO WORK WITH THEM AS IF THEY'RE THE SAME THING?** (No)

* **EXTRACT A COLUMN FROM A TABLE**
   * Use `$` notation in the console
   * **NOTE THE AUTOCOMPLETION**

```R
> cats$weight
[1] 2.1 5.0 3.2
```

* **WHAT DID `R` RETURN?**
    * A *vector* (1D ordered collection) of numbers
* **WE CAN OPERATE ON THESE *VECTORS* **
    * *Vectors* are an important concept, and `R` is largely built so that operations on vectors are central to data analysis.

```R
> cats$weight + 2
[1] 4.1 7.0 5.2
```

* **WHAT ABOUT OTHER COLUMNS?**

```R
> cats$coat
[1] calico black  tabby 
Levels: black calico tabby
```

* **WHAT DID `R` RETURN?**
    * A *vector* of *levels*
    * We'll talk about these in more detail shortly, but the key point is that `R` **DOESN'T THINK THEY'RE ONLY WORDS** - it **THINKS THEY'RE NAMED CATEGORIES OF OBJECT**. `R` is assuming that you mean to import *data*
    * We can operate on this vector, too (**EXPLAIN `paste()`**)

```R
> paste("My cat is", cats$coat)
[1] "My cat is calico" "My cat is black"  "My cat is tabby" 
```

* **WHAT HAPPENS NEXT?**

```R
> cats$weight + cats$coat
[1] NA NA NA
Warning message:
In Ops.factor(cats$weight, cats$coat) : â+â not meaningful for factors
```

* You probably already realised that wasn't going to work, because adding "calico" to "2.1" is nonsense.
* **THESE DATA TYPES ARE NOT COMPATIBLE** for addition
* `R`'s data types reflect the ways in which data is expected to interact
* **UNDERSTANDING HOW YOUR DATA MAP TO `R`'s DATA TYPES IS KEY**
   * It's very important to understand how `R` sees your data (you want `R` to see your data the same way you do)
   * Many problems in `R` come down to incompatibilities between data and data types.

----

**SLIDE: What Data Types Do You Expect?**

* **ASK THE STUDENTS**
    * What data types would you expect to see?
    * What data types do you think you would **WANT OR NEED**, from your own experience?
* **SPEND A COUPLE OF MINUTES ON THIS**
    * The difference between a *data type* and a *data structure*

----

**SLIDE: Data Types in `R`**

* `R`'s data *types* are *atomic*: they are **FUNDAMENTAL AND EVERYTHING ELSE IS BUILT UP FROM THEM**, like matter is built up from atoms
    * In particular, all the data *structures* are built up from data *types*
* There are only **FIVE DATA TYPES** in `R` (though one is split into twoâ¦)
    * **logical**: Boolean, True/False (also `1`/`0`)
    * **numeric**: anything that's a number on the number line; two types of number are supported: `integer` and `double` (real)
    * **complex**: complex numbers, defined on the 2D plane
    * **character**: text data - readable symbols
    * **raw**: binary data (we'll not be dealing with this)

* **LET'S LEARN A BIT MORE ABOUT THEM IN THE DEMO**
* **ENTER DEFINITIONS INTO THE SCRIPT**
    * Covering the major data types

```R
# Some variables of several data types
truth <- TRUE
lie <- FALSE
i <- 3L
d <- 3.0
c <- 3 + 0i
txt <- "TRUE"
```

* **EXECUTE THE VARIABLE DEFINITIONS**
    * Select the definition lines
    * Click on `Run`
    * **OBSERVE THAT THE LINES ARE RUN IN THE CONSOLE**
    * **OBSERVE THAT THE VALUES ARE DEFINED IN THE ENVIRONMENT**
    * Note the difference between `Data` and `Values` in the environment
    * Note that the script is updated in the `Git` tab: commit the change

* **USE `typeof()` TO FIND THE TYPE OF A VARIABLE**

```R
> typeof(i)
[1] "integer"
> typeof(c)
[1] "complex"
> typeof(d)
[1] "double"
```

* **TO TEST IF A DATA ITEM HAS A TYPE, USE `is.<type>()`**

```R
> is.numeric(3)
[1] TRUE
> is.numeric(d)
[1] TRUE
> is.double(i)
[1] FALSE
> is.integer(d)
[1] FALSE
> is.numeric(txt)
[1] FALSE
> is.character(txt)
[1] TRUE
> is.character(truth)
[1] FALSE
> is.logical(truth)
[1] TRUE
```

* **THE INTEGER, COMPLEX, AND DOUBLE ARE EQUAL** even if they're not the same data type
    * numbers are comparable, regardless of data type

```R
> i == c
[1] TRUE
> i == d
[1] TRUE
> d == c
[1] TRUE
```

* **INTEGER, COMPLEX AND DOUBLE ARE NOT ALL `numeric`** though

```R
> is.numeric(i)
[1] TRUE
> is.numeric(c)
[1] FALSE
```

**SLIDE: FIVE COMMON `R` DATA STRUCTURES**

* These are perhaps the five data types you'll come across most often in `R`
* We'll deal with them through examples
* **INTERACTIVE DEMO IN SCRIPT**

* **VECTORS**
    * These are the **MOST COMMON DATA STRUCTURE**
    * Vectors can contain **ONLY A SINGLE DATA TYPE** (*atomic vectors*)
    * **ADD CODE TO SCRIPT** then use `Run` to run in console
    * To create a vector **USE THE `c()` FUNCTION** (`c()` is `combine`; use `?c`)
    * First we define an **ATOMIC VECTOR OF NUMBERS** - each element is an integer

```R
# Define an integer vector
x <- c(10, 12, 45, 33)
```

* We can use some `R` functions to find out more about this variable
    * **RUN CODE IN CONSOLE**

```R
> length(x)
[1] 4
> typeof(x)
[1] "double"
> str(x)
 num [1:4] 10 12 45 33
``` 

* The `str()` function **REPORTS THE STRUCTURE OF A VARIABLE**
    * Here, `num` means 'numeric'; `[1:4]` means there are four elements; the elements are listed
    * **NOTE THAT THIS INFORMATION IS IN THE ENVIRONMENT TAB**
    
* **DEFINE A SECOND VECTOR IN THE SCRIPT**

```R
# Define a vector
xx <- c(1, 2, 'a')
```

* In the Environment tab, you can see **THIS IS A CHARACTER VECTOR**

```R
> length(xx)
[1] 3
> typeof(xx)
[1] "character"
> str(xx)
 chr [1:3] "1" "2" "a"
``` 

* **IS THE TYPE OF THE VECTOR WHAT YOU EXPECTED?**
    * This is one of the things that trips people up with `R` - they think their data is of one type, but `R` thinks it makes more sense to have it as another type

----

**SLIDE: Challenge 07**

* Let the students work for a couple of minutes, then demonstrate.

![images/red_green_sticky.png](images/red_green_sticky.png)

----

**SLIDE: Coercion**

* *Coercion* is what happens when you **COVERT ONE DATA TYPE INTO ANOTHER**
* If `R` thinks it needs to, it will **COERCE DATA IMPLICITLY** without telling you
* There is a set order for coercion
    * `logical` can be coerced to `integer`, but `integer` cannot be coerced to `logical`
    * That's because `integer` can describe all `logical` values, but not *vice versa*
    * Everything can be represented as a `character`, so that's the fallback position for `R`
* **IF THERE'S A FORMATTING PROBLEM IN YOUR DATA, `R` MIGHT CONVERT THE TYPE TO COPE**
    * `R` will choose the simplest data type that can represent all items in the vector

* **INTERACTIVE DEMO IN CONSOLE** More useful things to do with vectors
* You can (usually) **COERCE VECTORS MANUALLY** with `as.<type>()`

```R
> as.character(x)
[1] "10" "12" "45" "33"
> as.complex(x)
[1] 10+0i 12+0i 45+0i 33+0i
> as.logical(x)
[1] TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE
> xx
[1] "1" "2" "a"
> as.numeric(xx)
[1]  1  2 NA
Warning message:
NAs introduced by coercion 
> as.logical(xx)
[1] NA NA NA
```

* You can generate **NUMBER SEQUENCES** as vectors
    * The `seq()` function returns a vector
    * As does the `:` operator

```R
> seq(10)
 [1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10
> seq(1, 10)
 [1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10
> seq(35, 40, by=0.5)
 [1] 35.0 35.5 36.0 36.5 37.0 37.5 38.0 38.5 39.0 39.5 40.0
> 1:10
 [1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10
> 5:8
[1] 5 6 7 8 
```

* You can **APPEND ELEMENTS TO A VECTOR WITH `c()`**

```R
> x
[1] 10 12 45 33
> c(x, 57)
[1] 10 12 45 33 57
> x
[1] 10 12 45 33
> x <- c(x, 57)
> x
[1] 10 12 45 33 57
```

* There are useful **FUNCTIONS TO GET INFORMATION ABOUT A VECTOR**

```R
> x <- 0:10
> tail(x)
[1]  5  6  7  8  9 10
> head(x)
[1] 0 1 2 3 4 5
> head(x, n=2)
[1] 0 1
```

* You can **GIVE VECTOR ELEMENTS NAMES**
    * They're then referred to as *named vectors*

```R
> x <- 1:4
> names(x)
NULL
> str(x)
 int [1:4] 1 2 3 4
> names(x) <- c("a", "b", "c", "d")
> x
a b c d 
1 2 3 4 
> str(x)
 Named int [1:4] 1 2 3 4
 - attr(*, "names")= chr [1:4] "a" "b" "c" "d"
```
