**SLIDE: What is `R`?**

* `R` is a **PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE**, and the **SOFTWARE** that runs programs written in that language.
* This can sometimes be confusing - **IF AT ANY POINT I AM UNCLEAR, PLEASE ASK!**

* **HAS ANYONE IN THE ROOM USED `R` BEFORE? - GREEN STICKY**
    * If anyone has used `R`, please could you be available to help one of your neighbours who has not, if they have any questions. Look around you - if there's someone nearby with a green sticky, say 'hi'!

* **WHY USE OR TEACH `R`?**
    * `R` is **FREE**, and very **WIDELY-USED** across a range of disciplines.
    * There are **MANY USEFUL PACKAGES** or data analysis and statistics
    * It has excellent **GRAPHICS CAPABILITIES**
    * There is an international, friendly **COMMUNITY** across a range of disciplines, so it's easy to find local and online support
