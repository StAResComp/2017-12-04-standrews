# 01. Introduction to `R` and <br /> `RStudio`


## Learning Objectives

* Understand what `R` is
* Understand what `RStudio` is
* Understand why `R` is different from something like `Excel`


## What is `R`?

* `R` is a programming language
* `R` is the software that interprets programs written in the `R` programming language

<div class="highlight">
* **Have you used `R` before?**
</div>

> * `R` is free (commercial support can be bought)
> * `R` is widely-used and *interdisciplinary* (sciences, humanities, engineering, etc.)
> * `R` has many excellent packages for statistics and data analysis, visualisation and graphics
> * `R` has an international, friendly user community

<p>RStudio community support: [https://community.rstudio.com/](https://community.rstudio.com/)</p>
<p>Stack Overflow: [https://stackoverflow.com/](https://stackoverflow.com/)</p>
</div>


## "But I already know `Excel`…"

<div class="highlight">
* `Excel` is great for many things, but `R` is great for reproducibility…
</div>

> * ***Separates data from analysis***
> * Not point-and-click: *every step is explicit and transparent*
> * Easy to share, adapt, reuse, publish analyses with new/modified data (GitHub)
> * `R` can be run on supercomputers…

</div>


## What is `RStudio`?

* `RStudio` is an *integrated development environment* (IDE) - all platforms

</center>

<div class="highlight">
* Interaction with `R` (console/'scratchpad')
* Script/code editor
* Graphics/visualisation
* Project management (`git` integration)
</div>


# 02. Getting to know `RStudio`


## Learning Objectives

* Familiarity with the `RStudio` IDE
* Introduce `R` syntax
* Learn good project management practices
* Set up a working directory with version control (`git`) in `RStudio`
* Introduce package management


## `RStudio` overview - Interactive Demo

</center>

## Exercise 01 (5min)

* **Try out some of your own calculations in the interactive console**

```{r}
2 ** 16
15 %% 4
15 %/% 4
```

## Variables

<div class="highlight">
**Variables** are like *named boxes*
</div>

* An item of data goes in the box (called `Name`)
* When we refer the box (*variable*) with a name, we really mean *what's in the box*

<center>

</center>


## Variables - Interactive Demo

```{r}
name <- "Samia"
name
x <- 1 / 40
x
x ^ 2
log(x)
```


## Exercise 02 (5min)

What will be the value of each variable after each statement in the following program?

```{r, echo=TRUE}
mass <- 47.5
age <- 122
mass <- mass * 2.3
age <- age - 20
```

## Good Project Management Practices

<div class="highlight">
**No single 'right way' - only good principles**
</div>

* Use a single working directory per project/analysis
    - easier to move, share, and find files
    - use *relative paths* to locate files
* Treat raw data as read-only
    * keep in separate subfolder (`data`)?
* Clean data ready for work
    * keep cleaned/modified data in separate folder?
* Consider output generated by analysis to be disposable
    * can be regenerated by running analysis/code
    * don't place under version control
